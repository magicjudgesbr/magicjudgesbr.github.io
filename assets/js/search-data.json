Iniciando o Jogo", "title": "103. Iniciando o Jogo", "content": "103.1. At the start of a game, the players determine which one of them will choose who takes the first turn. In the first game of a match (including a single-game match), the players may use any mutually agreeable method (flipping a coin, rolling dice, etc.) to do so. In a match of several games, the loser of the previous game chooses who takes the first turn. If the previous game was a draw, the player who made the choice in that game makes the choice in this game. The player chosen to take the first turn is the starting player. The game\u2019s default turn order begins with the starting player and proceeds clockwise.\n103.1a In a game using the shared team turns option, there is a starting team rather than a starting player.\n103.1b In an Archenemy game, these methods aren\u2019t used to determine who takes the first turn. Rather, the archenemy takes the first turn.\n103.1c One card (Power Play) states that its controller is the starting player. This effect applies after this determination has happened and supersedes these methods.\n103.2. After the starting player has been determined, each player shuffles their deck so that the cards are in a random order. Each player may then shuffle or cut their opponents\u2019 decks. The players\u2019 decks become their libraries.\n103.2a If a player is using a sideboard (see rule 100.4) or cards being represented by substitute cards (see rule 713), those cards are set aside before shuffling.\n103.2b If a player wishes to reveal a card with a companion ability that they own from outside the game, they may do so after setting aside their sideboard. A player may reveal no more than one card this way, and they may do so only if their deck fulfills the condition of that card\u2019s companion ability. (See rule 702.138, \u201cCompanion.\u201d)\n103.2c In a Commander game, each player puts their commander from their deck face up into the command zone after having the opportunity to reveal a card with a companion ability and before shuffling. See rule 903.6.\n103.2d In a Conspiracy Draft game, each player puts any number of conspiracy cards from their sideboard into the command zone before shuffling. See rule 905.4.\n103.3. Each player begins the game with a starting life total of 20. Some variant games have different starting life totals.\n103.3a In a Two-Headed Giant game, each team\u2019s starting life total is 30.\n103.3b In a Vanguard game, each player\u2019s starting life total is 20 plus or minus the life modifier of their vanguard card.\n103.3c In a Commander game, each player\u2019s starting life total is 40.\n103.3d In a two-player Brawl game, each player\u2019s starting life total is 25. In a multiplayer Brawl game, each player\u2019s starting life total is 30.\n103.3e In an Archenemy game, the archenemy\u2019s starting life total is 40.\n103.4. Each player draws a number of cards equal to their starting hand size, which is normally seven. (Some effects can modify a player\u2019s starting hand size.) A player who is dissatisfied with their initial hand may take a mulligan. First, the starting player declares whether they will take a mulligan. Then each other player in turn order does the same. Once each player has made a declaration, all players who decided to take mulligans do so at the same time. To take a mulligan, a player shuffles the cards in their hand back into their library, draws a new hand of cards equal to their starting hand size, then puts a number of those cards equal to the number of times that player has taken a mulligan on the bottom of their library in any order. Once a player chooses not to take a mulligan, the remaining cards become that player\u2019s opening hand, and that player may not take any further mulligans. This process is then repeated until no player takes a mulligan. A player can take mulligans until their opening hand would be zero cards, after which they may not take further mulligans.\n103.4a In a Vanguard game, each player\u2019s starting hand size is seven plus or minus the hand modifier of their vanguard card.\n103.4b If an effect allows a player to perform an action \u201cany time [that player] could mulligan,\u201d the player may perform that action at a time they would declare whether they will take a mulligan. This need not be in the first round of mulligans. Other players may have already made their mulligan declarations by the time the player has the option to perform this action. If the player performs the action, they then declare whether they will take a mulligan.\n103.4c In a multiplayer game and in any Brawl game, the first mulligan a player takes doesn\u2019t count toward the number of cards that player will put on the bottom of their library or the number of mulligans that player may take. Subsequent mulligans are counted toward these numbers as normal.\n103.4d In a multiplayer game using the shared team turns option, first each player on the starting team declares whether that player will take a mulligan, then the players on each other team in turn order do the same. Teammates may consult while making their decisions. Then all mulligans are taken at the same time. A player may take a mulligan even after a teammate has decided to keep their opening hand.\n103.5. Some cards allow a player to take actions with them from their opening hand. Once the mulligan process (see rule 103.4) is complete, the starting player may take any such actions in any order. Then each other player in turn order may do the same.\n103.5a If a card allows a player to begin the game with that card on the battlefield, the player taking this action puts that card onto the battlefield.\n103.5b If a card allows a player to reveal it from their opening hand, the player taking this action does so. The card remains revealed until the first turn begins. Each card may be revealed this way only once.\n103.5c In a multiplayer game using the shared team turns option, first each player on the starting team, in whatever order that team likes, may take such actions. Teammates may consult while making their decisions. Then each player on each other team in turn order does the same.\n103.6. In a Planechase game, the starting player moves the top card of their planar deck off that planar deck and turns it face up. If it\u2019s a phenomenon card, the player puts that card on the bottom of their planar deck and repeats this process until a plane card is turned face up. The face-up plane card becomes the starting plane. (See rule 901, \u201cPlanechase.\u201d)\n103.7. The starting player takes their first turn.\n103.7a In a two-player game, the player who plays first skips the draw step (see rule 504, \u201cDraw Step\u201d) of their first turn.\n103.7b In a Two-Headed Giant game, the team who plays first skips the draw step of their first turn.\n103.7c In all other multiplayer games, no player skips the draw step of their first turn.", "url": "/regras/cr/1/103/"}, "104.1.": {"doc": "104.1.", "title": "104.1.", "content": "104.1.

The only numbers the Magic game uses are integers.\n107.1a You can\u2019t choose a fractional number, deal fractional damage, gain fractional life, and so on. If a spell or ability could generate a fractional number, the spell or ability will tell you whether to round up or down.\n107.1b Most of the time, the Magic game uses only positive numbers and zero. You can\u2019t choose a negative number, deal negative damage, gain negative life, and so on. However, it\u2019s possible for a game value, such as a creature\u2019s power, to be less than zero. If a calculation or comparison needs to use a negative value, it does so. If a calculation that would determine the result of an effect yields a negative number, zero is used instead, unless that effect doubles or sets to a specific value a player\u2019s life total or the power and/or toughness of a creature or creature card.\n107.1c If a rule or ability instructs a player to choose \u201cany number,\u201d that player may choose any positive number or zero.\n107.2. If anything needs to use a number that can\u2019t be determined, either as a result or in a calculation, it uses 0 instead.\n107.3. Many objects use the letter X as a placeholder for a number that needs to be determined. Some objects have abilities that define the value of X; the rest let their controller choose the value of X.\n107.3a If a spell or activated ability has a mana cost, alternative cost, additional cost, and/or activation cost with an {X}, [-X], or X in it, and the value of X isn\u2019t defined by the text of that spell or ability, the controller of that spell or ability chooses and announces the value of X as part of casting the spell or activating the ability. (See rule 601, \u201cCasting Spells.\u201d) While a spell is on the stack, any X in its mana cost or in any alternative cost or additional cost it has equals the announced value. While an activated ability is on the stack, any X in its activation cost equals the announced value.\n107.3b If a player is casting a spell that has an {X} in its mana cost, the value of X isn\u2019t defined by the text of that spell, and an effect lets that player cast that spell while paying neither its mana cost nor an alternative cost that includes X, then the only legal choice for X is 0. This doesn\u2019t apply to effects that only reduce a cost, even if they reduce it to zero. See rule 601, \u201cCasting Spells.\u201d\n107.3c If a spell or activated ability has an {X}, [-X], or X in its cost and/or its text, and the value of X is defined by the text of that spell or ability, then that\u2019s the value of X while that spell or ability is on the stack. The controller of that spell or ability doesn\u2019t get to choose the value. Note that the value of X may change while that spell or ability is on the stack.\n107.3d If a cost associated with a special action, such as a suspend cost or a morph cost, has an {X} or an X in it, the value of X is chosen by the player taking the special action immediately before they pay that cost.\n107.3e If a spell or ability refers to the {X} or X in the mana cost, alternative cost, additional cost, or activation cost of another object, any X in that spell or ability\u2019s text uses the value of X chosen or defined for the other object.\n107.3f Sometimes X appears in the text of a spell or ability but not in a mana cost, alternative cost, additional cost, or activation cost. If the value of X isn\u2019t defined, the controller of the spell or ability chooses the value of X at the appropriate time (either as it\u2019s put on the stack or as it resolves).\n107.3g If a card in any zone other than the stack has an {X} in its mana cost, the value of {X} is treated as 0, even if the value of X is defined somewhere within its text.\n107.3h If an effect instructs a player to pay an object\u2019s mana cost that includes {X}, the value of X is treated as 0 unless the object is a spell on the stack. In that case, the value of X is the value chosen or determined for it as the spell was cast.\n107.3i Normally, all instances of X on an object have the same value at any given time.\n107.3j If an object gains an ability, the value of X within that ability is the value defined by that ability, or 0 if that ability doesn\u2019t define a value of X. This is an exception to rule 107.3i. This may occur with ability-adding effects, text-changing effects, or copy effects.\n107.3k If an object\u2019s activated ability has an {X}, [-X], or X in its activation cost, the value of X for that ability is independent of any other values of X chosen for that object or for other instances of abilities of that object. This is an exception to rule 107.3i.\n107.3m If an object\u2019s enters-the-battlefield triggered ability or replacement effect refers to X, and the spell that became that object as it resolved had a value of X chosen for any of its costs, the value of X for that ability is the same as the value of X for that spell, although the value of X for that permanent is 0. This is an exception to rule 107.3i.\n107.3n Some objects use the letter Y in addition to the letter X. Y follows the same rules as X.\n107.4. The mana symbols are {W}, {U}, {B}, {R}, {G}, and {C}; the numerical symbols {0}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, and so on; the variable symbol {X}; the hybrid symbols {W/U}, {W/B}, {U/B}, {U/R}, {B/R}, {B/G}, {R/G}, {R/W}, {G/W}, and {G/U}; the monocolored hybrid symbols {2/W}, {2/U}, {2/B}, {2/R}, and {2/G}; the Phyrexian mana symbols {W/P}, {U/P}, {B/P}, {R/P}, and {G/P}; and the snow symbol {S}.\n107.4a There are five primary colored mana symbols: {W} is white, {U} blue, {B} black, {R} red, and {G} green. These symbols are used to represent colored mana, and also to represent colored mana in costs. Colored mana in costs can be paid only with the appropriate color of mana. See rule 202, \u201cMana Cost and Color.\u201d\n107.4b Numerical symbols (such as {1}) and variable symbols (such as {X}) represent generic mana in costs. Generic mana in costs can be paid with any type of mana. For more information about {X}, see rule 107.3.\n107.4c The colorless mana symbol {C} is used to represent one colorless mana, and also to represent a cost that can be paid only with one colorless mana.\n107.4d The symbol {0} represents zero mana and is used as a placeholder for a cost that can be paid with no resources. (See rule 118.5.)\n107.4e Hybrid mana symbols are also colored mana symbols. Each one represents a cost that can be paid in one of two ways, as represented by the two halves of the symbol. A hybrid symbol such as {W/U} can be paid with either white or blue mana, and a monocolored hybrid symbol such as {2/B} can be paid with either one black mana or two mana of any type. A hybrid mana symbol is all of its component colors.\n107.4f Phyrexian mana symbols are colored mana symbols: {W/P} is white, {U/P} is blue, {B/P} is black, {R/P} is red, and {G/P} is green. A Phyrexian mana symbol represents a cost that can be paid either with one mana of its color or by paying 2 life.\n107.4g In rules text, the Phyrexian symbol {P} with no colored background means any of the five Phyrexian mana symbols.\n107.4h The snow mana symbol {S} represents one mana in a cost. This mana can be paid with one mana of any type produced by a snow permanent (see rule 205.4g). Effects that reduce the amount of generic mana you pay don\u2019t affect {S} costs. Snow is neither a color nor a type of mana.\n107.5. The tap symbol is {T}. The tap symbol in an activation cost means \u201cTap this permanent.\u201d A permanent that\u2019s already tapped can\u2019t be tapped again to pay the cost. A creature\u2019s activated ability with the tap symbol in its activation cost can\u2019t be activated unless the creature has been under its controller\u2019s control continuously since their most recent turn began. See rule 302.6.\n107.6. The untap symbol is {Q}. The untap symbol in an activation cost means \u201cUntap this permanent.\u201d A permanent that\u2019s already untapped can\u2019t be untapped again to pay the cost. A creature\u2019s activated ability with the untap symbol in its activation cost can\u2019t be activated unless the creature has been under its controller\u2019s control continuously since their most recent turn began. See rule 302.6.\n107.7. Each activated ability of a planeswalker has a loyalty symbol in its cost. Positive loyalty symbols point upward and feature a plus sign followed by a number. Negative loyalty symbols point downward and feature a minus sign followed by a number or an X. Neutral loyalty symbols don\u2019t point in either direction and feature a 0. [+N] means \u201cPut N loyalty counters on this permanent,\u201d [-N] means \u201cRemove N loyalty counters from this permanent,\u201d and [0] means \u201cPut zero loyalty counters on this permanent.\u201d\n107.8. The text box of a leveler card contains two level symbols, each of which is a keyword ability that represents a static ability. The level symbol includes either a range of numbers, indicated here as \u201cN1-N2,\u201d or a single number followed by a plus sign, indicated here as \u201cN3+.\u201d Any abilities printed within the same text box striation as a level symbol are part of its static ability.

A tombstone icon appears to the left of the name of many Odyssey\u2122 block cards with abilities that are relevant in a player\u2019s graveyard. The purpose of the icon is to make those cards stand out when they\u2019re in a graveyard. This icon has no effect on game play.\n107.10. A type icon appears in the upper left corner of each card from the Future Sight\u00ae set printed with an alternate \u201ctimeshifted\u201d frame. If the card has a single card type, this icon indicates what it is: claw marks for creature, a flame for sorcery, a lightning bolt for instant, a sunrise for enchantment, a chalice for artifact, and a pair of mountain peaks for land. If the card has multiple card types, that\u2019s indicated by a black and white cross. This icon has no effect on game play.\n107.11. The Planeswalker symbol is {PW}. It appears on one face of the planar die used in the Planechase casual variant. See rule 901, \u201cPlanechase.\u201d\n107.12. The chaos symbol is {CHAOS}. It appears on one face of the planar die used in the Planechase casual variant, as well as in abilities that refer to the results of rolling the planar die. See rule 901, \u201cPlanechase.\u201d\n107.13. A color indicator is a circular symbol that appears to the left of the type line on some cards. The color of the symbol defines the card\u2019s color or colors. See rule 202, \u201cMana Cost and Color.\u201d\n107.14. The energy symbol is {E}. It represents one energy counter. To pay {E}, a player removes one energy counter from themselves.\n107.15. The text box of a Saga card contains chapter symbols, each of which is a keyword ability that represents a triggered ability.

Some continuous effects are replacement effects or prevention effects. See rule 609, \u201cEffects.\u201d\n113.3.

Any text on an instant or sorcery spell is a spell ability unless it\u2019s an activated ability, a triggered ability, or a static ability that fits the criteria described in rule 113.6.\n113.3b Activated abilities have a cost and an effect.

Doing so puts it on the stack, where it remains until it\u2019s countered, it resolves, or it otherwise leaves the stack.

Static abilities create continuous effects which are active while the permanent with the ability is on the battlefield and has the ability, or while the object with the ability is in the appropriate zone. See rule 604, \u201cHandling Static Abilities.\u201d\n113.4. Some activated abilities and some triggered abilities are mana abilities. Mana abilities follow special rules: They don\u2019t use the stack, and, under certain circumstances, a player can activate mana abilities even if they don\u2019t have priority. See rule 605, \u201cMana Abilities.\u201d\n113.5. Some activated abilities are loyalty abilities.

See rule 606, \u201cLoyalty Abilities.\u201d\n113.6. Abilities of an instant or sorcery spell usually function only while that object is on the stack. Abilities of all other objects usually function only while that object is on the battlefield. The exceptions are as follows:\n113.6a Characteristic-defining abilities function everywhere, even outside the game. (See rule 604.3.)\n113.6b An ability that states which zones it functions in functions only from those zones.\n113.6c An object\u2019s ability that allows a player to pay an alternative cost rather than its mana cost or otherwise modifies what that particular object costs to cast functions on the stack.\n113.6d An object\u2019s ability that restricts or modifies how that particular object can be played or cast functions in any zone from which it could be played or cast and also on the stack.

Other trigger conditions of the same triggered ability may function in different zones.\n113.6k An ability whose cost or effect specifies that it moves the object it\u2019s on out of a particular zone functions only in that zone, unless its trigger condition or a previous part of its cost or effect specifies that the object is put into that zone or, if the object is an Aura, that the object it enchants leaves the battlefield. The same is true if the effect of that ability creates a delayed triggered ability whose effect moves the object out of a particular zone.\n113.6m An ability that modifies the rules for deck construction functions before the game begins. Such an ability modifies not just the Comprehensive Rules, but also the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules and any other documents that set the deck construction rules for a specific format. However, such an ability can\u2019t affect the format legality of a card, including whether it\u2019s banned or restricted. The current Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules can be found at WPN.Wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents.\n113.6n Abilities of emblems, plane cards, vanguard cards, scheme cards, and conspiracy cards function in the command zone. See rule 114, \u201cEmblems\u201d; rule 901, \u201cPlanechase\u201d; rule 902, \u201cVanguard\u201d; rule 904, \u201cArchenemy\u201d; and rule 905, \u201cConspiracy Draft.\u201d\n113.7. The source of an ability is the object that generated it. The source of an activated ability on the stack is the object whose ability was activated. The source of a triggered ability (other than a delayed triggered ability) on the stack, or one that has triggered and is waiting to be put on the stack, is the object whose ability triggered. To determine the source of a delayed triggered ability, see rules 603.7d\u2013f.\n113.7a Once activated or triggered, an ability exists on the stack independently of its source. Destruction or removal of the source after that time won\u2019t affect the ability. Note that some abilities cause a source to do something (for example, \u201cProdigal Pyromancer deals 1 damage to any target\u201d) rather than the ability doing anything directly. In these cases, any activated or triggered ability that references information about the source for use while announcing an activated ability or putting a triggered ability on the stack checks that information when the ability is put onto the stack. Otherwise, it will check that information when it resolves. In both instances, if the source is no longer in the zone it\u2019s expected to be in at that time, its last known information is used. The source can still perform the action even though it no longer exists.\n113.8. The controller of an activated ability on the stack is the player who activated it. The controller of a triggered ability on the stack (other than a delayed triggered ability) is the player who controlled the ability\u2019s source when it triggered, or, if it had no controller, the player who owned the ability\u2019s source when it triggered. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered ability, see rules 603.7d\u2013f.\n113.9. Activated and triggered abilities on the stack aren\u2019t spells, and therefore can\u2019t be countered by anything that counters only spells. Activated and triggered abilities on the stack can be countered by effects that specifically counter abilities. Static abilities don\u2019t use the stack and thus can\u2019t be countered at all.\n113.10. Effects can add or remove abilities of objects. An effect that adds an ability will state that the object \u201cgains\u201d or \u201chas\u201d that ability, or similar. An effect that removes an ability will state that the object \u201closes\u201d that ability.\n113.10a An effect that adds an activated ability may include activation instructions for that ability. These instructions become part of the ability that\u2019s added to the object.\n113.10b Effects that remove an ability remove all instances of it.\n113.10c If two or more effects add and remove the same ability, in general the most recent one prevails. See rule 613 for more information about the interaction of continuous effects.\n113.11. Effects can stop an object from having a specified ability. These effects say that the object \u201ccan\u2019t have\u201d that ability. If the object has that ability, it loses it. It\u2019s also impossible for an effect to add that ability to the object. If a resolving spell or ability creates a continuous effect that would add the specified ability to such an object, that part of that continuous effect does not apply; however, other parts of that continuous effect will still apply, and that resolving spell or ability can still create other continuous effects. Continuous effects created by static abilities that would add the specified ability won\u2019t apply to that object.\n113.12. An effect that sets an object\u2019s characteristic, or simply states a quality of that object, is different from an ability granted by an effect. When an object \u201cgains\u201d or \u201chas\u201d an ability, that ability can be removed by another effect. If an effect defines a characteristic of the object (\u201c[permanent] is [characteristic value]\u201d), it\u2019s not granting an ability. (See rule 604.3.) Similarly, if an effect states a quality of that object (\u201c[creature] can\u2019t be blocked,\u201d for example), it\u2019s neither granting an ability nor setting a characteristic.", "url": "/regras/cr/1/113/"}, "114.1.": {"doc": "114.1.", "title": "114.1.", "content": "114.1.

Custos", "title": "118. Custos", "content": "118.1. A cost is an action or payment necessary to take another action or to stop another action from taking place. To pay a cost, a player carries out the instructions specified by the spell, ability, or effect that contains that cost.\n118.2. If a cost includes a mana payment, the player paying the cost has a chance to activate mana abilities. Paying the cost to cast a spell or activate an activated ability follows the steps in rules 601.2f\u2013h.\n118.3. A player can\u2019t pay a cost without having the necessary resources to pay it fully. For example, a player with only 1 life can\u2019t pay a cost of 2 life, and a permanent that\u2019s already tapped can\u2019t be tapped to pay a cost. See rule 202, \u201cMana Cost and Color,\u201d and rule 602, \u201cActivating Activated Abilities.\u201d\n118.3a Paying mana is done by removing the indicated mana from a player\u2019s mana pool. (Players can always pay 0 mana.) If excess mana remains in that player\u2019s mana pool after making that payment, the player announces what mana is still there.\n118.3b Paying life is done by subtracting the indicated amount of life from a player\u2019s life total. (Players can always pay 0 life.)\n118.3c Activating mana abilities is not mandatory, even if paying a cost is.\n118.4. Some costs include an {X} or an X. See rule 107.3.\n118.5. Some costs are represented by {0}, or are reduced to {0}. The action necessary for a player to pay such a cost is the player\u2019s acknowledgment that they are paying it. Even though such a cost requires no resources, it\u2019s not automatically paid.\n118.5a A spell whose mana cost is {0} must still be cast the same way as one with a cost greater than zero; it won\u2019t cast itself automatically. The same is true for an activated ability whose cost is {0}.\n118.6. Some objects have no mana cost. This represents an unpayable cost. An ability can also have an unpayable cost if its cost is based on the mana cost of an object with no mana cost. Attempting to cast a spell or activate an ability that has an unpayable cost is a legal action. However, attempting to pay an unpayable cost is an illegal action.\n118.6a If an unpayable cost is increased by an effect or an additional cost is imposed, the cost is still unpayable. If an alternative cost is applied to an unpayable cost, including an effect that allows a player to cast a spell without paying its mana cost, the alternative cost may be paid.\n118.7. What a player actually needs to do to pay a cost may be changed or reduced by effects. If the mana component of a cost is reduced to nothing by cost reduction effects, it\u2019s considered to be {0}. Paying a cost changed or reduced by an effect counts as paying the original cost.\n118.7a Effects that reduce a cost by an amount of generic mana affect only the generic mana component of that cost. They can\u2019t affect the colored or colorless mana components of that cost.\n118.7b If a cost is reduced by an amount of colored or colorless mana, but the cost doesn\u2019t require mana of that type, the cost is reduced by that amount of generic mana.\n118.7c If a cost is reduced by an amount of colored mana that exceeds its mana component of that color, the cost\u2019s mana component of that color is reduced to nothing and the cost\u2019s generic mana component is reduced by the difference.\n118.7d If a cost is reduced by an amount of colorless mana that exceeds its colorless mana component, the cost\u2019s colorless mana component is reduced to nothing and the cost\u2019s generic mana component is reduced by the difference.\n118.7e If a cost is reduced by an amount of mana represented by a hybrid mana symbol, the player paying that cost chooses one half of that symbol at the time the cost reduction is applied (see rule 601.2f). If a colored half is chosen, the cost is reduced by one mana of that color. If a generic half is chosen, the cost is reduced by an amount of generic mana equal to that half\u2019s number.\n118.7f If a cost is reduced by an amount of mana represented by a Phyrexian mana symbol, the cost is reduced by one mana of that symbol\u2019s color.\n118.7g If a cost is reduced by an amount of mana represented by one or more snow mana symbols, the cost is reduced by that much generic mana.\n118.8. Some spells and abilities have additional costs. An additional cost is a cost listed in a spell\u2019s rules text, or applied to a spell or ability from another effect, that its controller must pay at the same time they pay the spell\u2019s mana cost or the ability\u2019s activation cost. Note that some additional costs are listed in keywords; see rule 702.\n118.8a Any number of additional costs may be applied to a spell as it\u2019s being cast or to an ability as it\u2019s being activated. The controller of the spell or ability announces their intentions to pay any or all of those costs as described in rule 601.2b.\n118.8b Some additional costs are optional.\n118.8c If an effect instructs a player to cast a spell \u201cif able,\u201d and that spell has a mandatory additional cost that includes actions involving cards with a stated quality in a hidden zone, the player isn\u2019t required to cast that spell, even if those cards are present in that zone.\n118.8d Additional costs don\u2019t change a spell\u2019s mana cost, only what its controller has to pay to cast it. Spells and abilities that ask for that spell\u2019s mana cost still see the original value.\n118.9. Some spells have alternative costs. An alternative cost is a cost listed in a spell\u2019s text, or applied to it from another effect, that its controller may pay rather than paying the spell\u2019s mana cost. Alternative costs are usually phrased, \u201cYou may [action] rather than pay [this object\u2019s] mana cost,\u201d or \u201cYou may cast [this object] without paying its mana cost.\u201d Note that some alternative costs are listed in keywords; see rule 702.\n118.9a Only one alternative cost can be applied to any one spell as it\u2019s being cast. The controller of the spell announces their intentions to pay that cost as described in rule 601.2b.\n118.9b Alternative costs are generally optional. An effect that allows you to cast a spell may require a certain alternative cost to be paid.\n118.9c An alternative cost doesn\u2019t change a spell\u2019s mana cost, only what its controller has to pay to cast it. Spells and abilities that ask for that spell\u2019s mana cost still see the original value.\n118.9d If an alternative cost is being paid to cast a spell, any additional costs, cost increases, and cost reductions that affect that spell are applied to that alternative cost. (See rule 601.2f.)\n118.10. Each payment of a cost applies to only one spell, ability, or effect. For example, a player can\u2019t sacrifice just one creature to activate the activated abilities of two permanents that each require sacrificing a creature as a cost. Also, the resolution of a spell or ability doesn\u2019t pay another spell or ability\u2019s cost, even if part of its effect is doing the same thing the other cost asks for.\n118.11. The actions performed when paying a cost may be modified by effects. Even if they are, meaning the actions that are performed don\u2019t match the actions that are called for, the cost has still been paid.\n118.12. Some spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities read, \u201c[Do something]. If [a player] [does, doesn\u2019t, or can\u2019t], [effect].\u201d or \u201c[A player] may [do something]. If [that player] [does, doesn\u2019t, or can\u2019t], [effect].\u201d The action [do something] is a cost, paid when the spell or ability resolves. The \u201cIf [a player] [does, doesn\u2019t, or can\u2019t]\u201d clause checks whether the player chose to pay an optional cost or started to pay a mandatory cost, regardless of what events actually occurred.\n118.12a Some spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities read, \u201c[Do something] unless [a player does something else].\u201d This means the same thing as \u201c[A player may do something else]. If [that player doesn\u2019t], [do something].\u201d\n118.12b Some effects offer a player a choice to search a zone and take additional actions with the cards found in that zone, followed by an \u201cIf [a player] does\u201d clause. This clause checks whether the player chose to search, not whether the player took any of the additional actions.\n118.13. Some costs contain mana symbols that can be paid in multiple ways. These include hybrid mana symbols and Phyrexian mana symbols.\n118.13a If the mana cost of a spell or the activation cost of an activated ability contains a mana symbol that can be paid in multiple ways, the choice of how to pay for that symbol is made as its controller proposes that spell or ability (see rule 601.2b).\n118.13b If a cost paid during the resolution of a spell or ability contains a mana symbol that can be paid in multiple ways, the player paying that cost chooses how to pay for that symbol immediately before they pay that cost.\n118.13c If the cost associated with a special action contains a mana symbol that can be paid in multiple ways, the player taking the special action chooses how to pay for that symbol immediately before they pay that cost.", "url": "/regras/cr/1/118/"}, "119.1.": {"doc": "119.1.", "title": "119.1.", "content": "119.1.

See rule 902, \u201cVanguard.\u201d\n119.1c In a Commander game, each player\u2019s starting life total is 40. See rule 903, \u201cCommander.\u201d\n119.1d. In a two-player Brawl game, each player\u2019s starting life total is 25. In a multiplayer Brawl game, each player\u2019s starting life total is 30. See rule 903.12, \u201cBrawl Option.\u201d\n119.1e In an Archenemy game, the archenemy\u2019s starting life total is 40. See rule 904, \u201cArchenemy.\u201d\n119.2. Damage dealt to a player normally causes that player to lose that much life. See rule 120.3.\n119.3. If an effect causes a player to gain life or lose life, that player\u2019s life total is adjusted accordingly.\n119.4. If a cost or effect allows a player to pay an amount of life greater than 0, the player may do so only if their life total is greater than or equal to the amount of the payment. If a player pays life, the payment is subtracted from their life total; in other words, the player loses that much life. (Players can always pay 0 life.)\n119.4a If a cost or effect allows a player to pay an amount of life greater than 0 in a Two-Headed Giant game, the player may do so only if their team\u2019s life total is greater than or equal to the total amount of life both team members are paying for that cost or effect. If a player pays life, the payment is subtracted from their team\u2019s life total. (Players can always pay 0 life.)\n119.5. If an effect sets a player\u2019s life total to a specific number, the player gains or loses the necessary amount of life to end up with the new total.\n119.6. If a player has 0 or less life, that player loses the game as a state-based action. See rule 704.\n119.7. If an effect says that a player can\u2019t gain life, that player can\u2019t make an exchange such that the player\u2019s life total would become higher; in that case, the exchange won\u2019t happen. Similarly, if an effect redistributes life totals, a player can\u2019t receive a new life total such that the player\u2019s life total would become higher. In addition, a cost that involves having that player gain life can\u2019t be paid, and a replacement effect that would replace a life gain event affecting that player won\u2019t do anything.\n119.8. If an effect says that a player can\u2019t lose life, that player can\u2019t make an exchange such that the player\u2019s life total would become lower; in that case, the exchange won\u2019t happen. Similarly, if an effect redistributes life totals, a player can\u2019t receive a new life total such that the player\u2019s life total would become lower. In addition, a cost that involves having that player pay life can\u2019t be paid.\n119.9. Some triggered abilities are written, \u201cWhenever [a player] gains life, . . . .\u201d Such abilities are treated as though they are written, \u201cWhenever a source causes [a player] to gain life, . . . .\u201d If a player gains 0 life, no life gain event has occurred, and these abilities won\u2019t trigger.\n119.10.

Subtypes of planes are also listed after a long dash, but may be multiple words; all words after the dash are, collectively, a single subtype.\n205.3c If a card with multiple card types has one or more subtypes, each subtype is correlated to its appropriate card type.\n205.3d An object can\u2019t gain a subtype that doesn\u2019t correspond to one of that object\u2019s types.\n205.3e If an effect instructs a player to choose a subtype, that player must choose one, and only one, existing subtype, and the subtype must be for the appropriate card type. For example, the player can\u2019t choose a land type if an instruction requires choosing a creature type.\n205.3f Many cards were printed with subtypes that are now obsolete. Many cards have retroactively received subtypes. Use the Oracle card reference to determine what a card\u2019s subtypes are. (See rule 108.1.)\n205.3g Artifacts have their own unique set of subtypes; these subtypes are called artifact types. The artifact types are Clue, Contraption, Equipment (see rule 301.5), Food, Fortification (see rule 301.6), Gold, Treasure, and Vehicle (see rule 301.7).\n205.3h Enchantments have their own unique set of subtypes; these subtypes are called enchantment types. The enchantment types are Aura (see rule 303.4), Cartouche, Curse, Saga (see rule 714), and Shrine.\n205.3i Lands have their own unique set of subtypes; these subtypes are called land types. The land types are Desert, Forest, Gate, Island, Lair, Locus, Mine, Mountain, Plains, Power-Plant, Swamp, Tower, and Urza\u2019s.\n205.3j Planeswalkers have their own unique set of subtypes; these subtypes are called planeswalker types. The planeswalker types are Ajani, Aminatou, Angrath, Arlinn, Ashiok, Basri, Bolas, Calix, Chandra, Dack, Daretti, Davriel, Domri, Dovin, Elspeth, Estrid, Freyalise, Garruk, Gideon, Huatli, Jace, Jaya, Karn, Kasmina, Kaya, Kiora, Koth, Liliana, Lukka, Nahiri, Narset, Nissa, Nixilis, Oko, Ral, Rowan, Saheeli, Samut, Sarkhan, Serra, Sorin, Tamiyo, Teferi, Teyo, Tezzeret, Tibalt, Ugin, Venser, Vivien, Vraska, Will, Windgrace, Wrenn, Xenagos, Yanggu, and Yanling.\n205.3k Instants and sorceries share their lists of subtypes; these subtypes are called spell types. The spell types are Adventure, Arcane, and Trap.\n205.3m Creatures and tribals share their lists of subtypes; these subtypes are called creature types. The creature types are Advisor, Aetherborn, Ally, Angel, Antelope, Ape, Archer, Archon, Army, Artificer, Assassin, Assembly-Worker, Atog, Aurochs, Avatar, Azra, Badger, Barbarian, Basilisk, Bat, Bear, Beast, Beeble, Berserker, Bird, Blinkmoth, Boar, Bringer, Brushwagg, Camarid, Camel, Caribou, Carrier, Cat, Centaur, Cephalid, Chimera, Citizen, Cleric, Cockatrice, Construct, Coward, Crab, Crocodile, Cyclops, Dauthi, Demigod, Demon, Deserter, Devil, Dinosaur, Djinn, Dog, Dragon, Drake, Dreadnought, Drone, Druid, Dryad, Dwarf, Efreet, Egg, Elder, Eldrazi, Elemental, Elephant, Elf, Elk, Eye, Faerie, Ferret, Fish, Flagbearer, Fox, Frog, Fungus, Gargoyle, Germ, Giant, Gnome, Goat, Goblin, God, Golem, Gorgon, Graveborn, Gremlin, Griffin, Hag, Harpy, Hellion, Hippo, Hippogriff, Homarid, Homunculus, Horror, Horse, Human, Hydra, Hyena, Illusion, Imp, Incarnation, Insect, Jackal, Jellyfish, Juggernaut, Kavu, Kirin, Kithkin, Knight, Kobold, Kor, Kraken, Lamia, Lammasu, Leech, Leviathan, Lhurgoyf, Licid, Lizard, Manticore, Masticore, Mercenary, Merfolk, Metathran, Minion, Minotaur, Mole, Monger, Mongoose, Monk, Monkey, Moonfolk, Mouse, Mutant, Myr, Mystic, Naga, Nautilus, Nephilim, Nightmare, Nightstalker, Ninja, Noble, Noggle, Nomad, Nymph, Octopus, Ogre, Ooze, Orb, Orc, Orgg, Otter, Ouphe, Ox, Oyster, Pangolin, Peasant, Pegasus, Pentavite, Pest, Phelddagrif, Phoenix, Pilot, Pincher, Pirate, Plant, Praetor, Prism, Processor, Rabbit, Rat, Rebel, Reflection, Rhino, Rigger, Rogue, Sable, Salamander, Samurai, Sand, Saproling, Satyr, Scarecrow, Scion, Scorpion, Scout, Sculpture, Serf, Serpent, Servo, Shade, Shaman, Shapeshifter, Shark, Sheep, Siren, Skeleton, Slith, Sliver, Slug, Snake, Soldier, Soltari, Spawn, Specter, Spellshaper, Sphinx, Spider, Spike, Spirit, Splinter, Sponge, Squid, Squirrel, Starfish, Surrakar, Survivor, Tentacle, Tetravite, Thalakos, Thopter, Thrull, Treefolk, Trilobite, Triskelavite, Troll, Turtle, Unicorn, Vampire, Vedalken, Viashino, Volver, Wall, Warlock, Warrior, Weird, Werewolf, Whale, Wizard, Wolf, Wolverine, Wombat, Worm, Wraith, Wurm, Yeti, Zombie, and Zubera.\n205.3n Planes have their own unique set of subtypes; these subtypes are called planar types.

Supertypes\n205.4a A card can also have one or more supertypes. These are printed directly before its card types. The supertypes are basic, legendary, ongoing, snow, and world.\n205.4b An object\u2019s supertype is independent of its card type and subtype, even though some supertypes are closely identified with specific card types. Changing an object\u2019s card types or subtypes won\u2019t change its supertypes. Changing an object\u2019s supertypes won\u2019t change its card types or subtypes. When an object gains or loses a supertype, it retains any other supertypes it had.\n205.4c Any land with the supertype \u201cbasic\u201d is a basic land. Any land that doesn\u2019t have this supertype is a nonbasic land, even if it has a basic land type.\n205.4d Any permanent with the supertype \u201clegendary\u201d is subject to the state-based action for legendary permanents, also called the \u201clegend rule\u201d (see rule 704.5j).\n205.4e Any instant or sorcery spell with the supertype \u201clegendary\u201d is subject to a casting restriction. A player can\u2019t cast a legendary instant or sorcery spell unless that player controls a legendary creature or a legendary planeswalker.\n205.4f Any permanent with the supertype \u201cworld\u201d is subject to the state-based action for world permanents, also called the \u201cworld rule\u201d (see rule 704.5k).\n205.4g Any permanent with the supertype \u201csnow\u201d is a snow permanent. Any permanent that doesn\u2019t have this supertype is a nonsnow permanent, regardless of its name.\n205.4h Any scheme card with the supertype \u201congoing\u201d is exempt from the state-based action for schemes (see rule 704.6e).", "url": "/regras/cr/2/205/"}, "206.1.": {"doc": "206.1.", "title": "206.1.", "content": "206.1.

This isn\u2019t the same as \u201cplaying a land\u201d and doesn\u2019t count as a land played during the current turn.\n305.5. Land subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash. Land subtypes are also called land types. Lands may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3i for the complete list of land types.\n305.6. The basic land types are Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest. If an object uses the words \u201cbasic land type,\u201d it\u2019s referring to one of these subtypes. An object with the land card type and a basic land type has the intrinsic ability \u201c{T}: Add [mana symbol],\u201d even if the text box doesn\u2019t actually contain that text or the object has no text box. For Plains, [mana symbol] is {W}; for Islands, {U}; for Swamps, {B}; for Mountains, {R}; and for Forests, {G}. See rule 107.4a. See also rule 605, \u201cMana Abilities.\u201d\n305.7. If an effect sets a land\u2019s subtype to one or more of the basic land types, the land no longer has its old land type. It loses all abilities generated from its rules text, its old land types, and any copy effects affecting that land, and it gains the appropriate mana ability for each new basic land type. Note that this doesn\u2019t remove any abilities that were granted to the land by other effects. Setting a land\u2019s subtype doesn\u2019t add or remove any card types (such as creature) or supertypes (such as basic, legendary, and snow) the land may have. If a land gains one or more land types in addition to its own, it keeps its land types and rules text, and it gains the new land types and mana abilities.\n305.8. Any land with the supertype \u201cbasic\u201d is a basic land. Any land that doesn\u2019t have this supertype is a nonbasic land, even if it has a basic land type.\n305.9. If an object is both a land and another card type, it can be played only as a land.

This turn-based action doesn\u2019t use the stack. To declare attackers, the active player follows the steps below, in order. If at any point during the declaration of attackers, the active player is unable to comply with any of the steps listed below, the declaration is illegal; the game returns to the moment before the declaration (see rule 723, \u201cHandling Illegal Actions\u201d).\n508.1a The active player chooses which creatures that they control, if any, will attack. The chosen creatures must be untapped, and each one must either have haste or have been controlled by the active player continuously since the turn began.\n508.1b If the defending player controls any planeswalkers, or the game allows the active player to attack multiple other players, the active player announces which player or planeswalker each of the chosen creatures is attacking.\n508.1c The active player checks each creature they control to see whether it\u2019s affected by any restrictions (effects that say a creature can\u2019t attack, or that it can\u2019t attack unless some condition is met). If any restrictions are being disobeyed, the declaration of attackers is illegal.\n508.1d The active player checks each creature they control to see whether it\u2019s affected by any requirements (effects that say a creature attacks if able, or that it attacks if some condition is met). If the number of requirements that are being obeyed is fewer than the maximum possible number of requirements that could be obeyed without disobeying any restrictions, the declaration of attackers is illegal. If a creature can\u2019t attack unless a player pays a cost, that player is not required to pay that cost, even if attacking with that creature would increase the number of requirements being obeyed. If a requirement that says a creature attacks if able during a certain turn refers to a turn with multiple combat phases, the creature attacks if able during each declare attackers step in that turn.\n508.1e If any of the chosen creatures have banding or a \u201cbands with other\u201d ability, the active player announces which creatures, if any, are banded with which. (See rule 702.21, \u201cBanding.\u201d)\n508.1f The active player taps the chosen creatures. Tapping a creature when it\u2019s declared as an attacker isn\u2019t a cost; attacking simply causes creatures to become tapped.\n508.1g If there are any optional costs to attack with the chosen creatures (expressed as costs a player may pay \u201cas\u201d a creature attacks), the active player chooses which, if any, they will pay.\n508.1h If any of the chosen creatures require paying costs to attack, or if any optional costs to attack were chosen, the active player determines the total cost to attack. Costs may include paying mana, tapping permanents, sacrificing permanents, discarding cards, and so on. Once the total cost is determined, it becomes \u201clocked in.\u201d If effects would change the total cost after this time, ignore this change.\n508.1i If any of the costs require mana, the active player then has a chance to activate mana abilities (see rule 605, \u201cMana Abilities\u201d).\n508.1j Once the player has enough mana in their mana pool, they pay all costs in any order. Partial payments are not allowed.\n508.1k Each chosen creature still controlled by the active player becomes an attacking creature. It remains an attacking creature until it\u2019s removed from combat or the combat phase ends, whichever comes first. See rule 506.4.\n508.1m Any abilities that trigger on attackers being declared trigger.\n508.2. Second, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, \u201cTiming and Priority.\u201d)\n508.2a Abilities that trigger on a creature attacking trigger only at the point the creature is declared as an attacker. They will not trigger if a creature attacks and then that creature\u2019s characteristics change to match the ability\u2019s trigger condition.\n508.2b Any abilities that triggered on attackers being declared or that triggered during the process described in rules 508.1 are put onto the stack before the active player gets priority; the order in which they triggered doesn\u2019t matter. (See rule 603, \u201cHandling Triggered Abilities.\u201d)\n508.3. Triggered abilities that trigger on attackers being declared may have different trigger conditions.\n508.3a An ability that reads \u201cWhenever [a creature] attacks, . . .\u201d triggers if that creature is declared as an attacker. Similarly, \u201cWhenever [a creature] attacks [a player or planeswalker], . . .\u201d triggers if that creature is declared as an attacker attacking that player or planeswalker. Such abilities won\u2019t trigger if a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking.\n508.3b An ability that reads \u201cWhenever [a player or planeswalker] is attacked, . . .\u201d triggers if one or more creatures are declared as attackers attacking that player or planeswalker. It won\u2019t trigger if a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking that player or planeswalker.\n508.3c An ability that reads \u201cWhenever [a player] attacks with [a creature], . . .\u201d triggers whenever a creature that player controls is declared as an attacker.\n508.3d An ability that reads \u201cWhenever [a creature] attacks and isn\u2019t blocked, . . .\u201d triggers during the declare blockers step, not the declare attackers step. See rule 509.5g.\n508.4. If a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking, its controller chooses which defending player or which planeswalker a defending player controls it\u2019s attacking as it enters the battlefield (unless the effect that put it onto the battlefield specifies what it\u2019s attacking). Similarly, if an effect states that a creature is attacking, its controller chooses which defending player or which planeswalker a defending player controls it\u2019s attacking it becomes attacking (unless the effect has already specified). Such creatures are \u201cattacking\u201d but, for the purposes of trigger events and effects, they never \u201cattacked.\u201d\n508.4a If the effect that puts a creature onto the battlefield attacking specifies it\u2019s attacking a certain player, and that player is no longer in the game when the effect resolves, the creature is put onto the battlefield but is never considered an attacking creature. The same is true if the effect specifies a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking a planeswalker and that planeswalker is no longer on the battlefield or is no longer a planeswalker when the effect resolves.\n508.4b If the effect that states a creature is attacking specifies it\u2019s attacking a certain player, and that player is no longer in the game when the effect resolves, the creature doesn\u2019t become an attacking creature. The same is true if the effect specifies a creature is attacking a planeswalker and that planeswalker is no longer on the battlefield or is no longer a planeswalker when the effect resolves.\n508.4c A creature that\u2019s put onto the battlefield attacking or that is stated to be attacking isn\u2019t affected by requirements or restrictions that apply to the declaration of attackers.\n508.5. If an ability of an attacking creature refers to a defending player, or a spell or ability refers to both an attacking creature and a defending player, then unless otherwise specified, the defending player it\u2019s referring to is the player that creature is attacking, or the controller of the planeswalker that creature is attacking. If that creature is no longer attacking, the defending player it\u2019s referring to is the player that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat or the controller of the planeswalker that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat.\n508.5a In a multiplayer game, any rule, object, or effect that refers to a \u201cdefending player\u201d refers to one specific defending player, not to all of the defending players. If a spell or ability could apply to multiple attacking creatures, the appropriate defending player is individually determined for each of those attacking creatures. If there are multiple defending players that could be chosen, the controller of the spell or ability chooses one.\n508.6. A player is \u201cattacking [a player]\u201d if the first player controls a creature that is attacking the second player. A player has \u201cattacked [a player]\u201d if the first player declared one or more creatures as attackers attacking the second player.\n508.7. One card (Portal Mage) allows a player to reselect which player or planeswalker a creature is attacking.\n508.7a The attacking creature isn\u2019t removed from combat and it isn\u2019t considered to have attacked a second time. That creature is attacking the reselected player or planeswalker, but it\u2019s still considered to have attacked the player or planeswalker chosen as it was declared as an attacker.\n508.7b While reselecting which player or planeswalker a creature is attacking, that creature isn\u2019t affected by requirements or restrictions that apply to the declaration of attackers.\n508.7c The reselected player or planeswalker must be an opponent of the attacking creature\u2019s controller, or a planeswalker controlled by an opponent of the attacking creature\u2019s controller.\n508.7d In a multiplayer game not using the attack multiple players option (see rule 802), the reselected player or planeswalker must be the chosen defending player or a planeswalker controlled by that player.\n508.7e In a multiplayer game using the limited range of influence option (see rule 801), the reselected player or planeswalker must be within the range of influence of the attacking creature\u2019s controller.\n508.8.

Etapa de Declara\u00e7\u00e3o de Bloqueadores", "title": "509. Etapa de Declara\u00e7\u00e3o de Bloqueadores", "content": "509.1. First, the defending player declares blockers. This turn-based action doesn\u2019t use the stack. To declare blockers, the defending player follows the steps below, in order. If at any point during the declaration of blockers, the defending player is unable to comply with any of the steps listed below, the declaration is illegal; the game returns to the moment before the declaration (see rule 723, \u201cHandling Illegal Actions\u201d).\n509.1a The defending player chooses which creatures they control, if any, will block. The chosen creatures must be untapped. For each of the chosen creatures, the defending player chooses one creature for it to block that\u2019s attacking that player or a planeswalker they control.\n509.1b The defending player checks each creature they control to see whether it\u2019s affected by any restrictions (effects that say a creature can\u2019t block, or that it can\u2019t block unless some condition is met). If any restrictions are being disobeyed, the declaration of blockers is illegal.\n509.1c The defending player checks each creature they control to see whether it\u2019s affected by any requirements (effects that say a creature must block, or that it must block if some condition is met). If the number of requirements that are being obeyed is fewer than the maximum possible number of requirements that could be obeyed without disobeying any restrictions, the declaration of blockers is illegal. If a creature can\u2019t block unless a player pays a cost, that player is not required to pay that cost, even if blocking with that creature would increase the number of requirements being obeyed. If a requirement that says a creature blocks if able during a certain turn refers to a turn with multiple combat phases, the creature blocks if able during each declare blockers step in that turn.\n509.1d If any of the chosen creatures require paying costs to block, the defending player determines the total cost to block. Costs may include paying mana, tapping permanents, sacrificing permanents, discarding cards, and so on. Once the total cost is determined, it becomes \u201clocked in.\u201d If effects would change the total cost after this time, ignore this change.\n509.1e If any of the costs require mana, the defending player then has a chance to activate mana abilities (see rule 605, \u201cMana Abilities\u201d).\n509.1f Once the player has enough mana in their mana pool, they pay all costs in any order. Partial payments are not allowed.\n509.1g Each chosen creature still controlled by the defending player becomes a blocking creature. Each one is blocking the attacking creatures chosen for it. It remains a blocking creature until it\u2019s removed from combat or the combat phase ends, whichever comes first. See rule 506.4.\n509.1h An attacking creature with one or more creatures declared as blockers for it becomes a blocked creature; one with no creatures declared as blockers for it becomes an unblocked creature. This remains unchanged until the creature is removed from combat, an effect says that it becomes blocked or unblocked, or the combat phase ends, whichever comes first. A creature remains blocked even if all the creatures blocking it are removed from combat.\n509.1i Any abilities that trigger on blockers being declared trigger. See rule 509.4 for more information.\n509.2. Second, for each attacking creature that\u2019s become blocked, the active player announces that creature\u2019s damage assignment order, which consists of the creatures blocking it in an order of that player\u2019s choice. (During the combat damage step, an attacking creature can\u2019t assign combat damage to a creature that\u2019s blocking it unless each creature ahead of that blocking creature in its order is assigned lethal damage.) This turn-based action doesn\u2019t use the stack.\n509.2a During the declare blockers step, if a blocking creature is removed from combat or a spell or ability causes it to stop blocking an attacking creature, the blocking creature is removed from all relevant damage assignment orders. The relative order among the remaining blocking creatures is unchanged.\n509.3. Third, for each blocking creature, the defending player announces that creature\u2019s damage assignment order, which consists of the creatures it\u2019s blocking in an order of that player\u2019s choice. (During the combat damage step, a blocking creature can\u2019t assign combat damage to a creature it\u2019s blocking unless each creature ahead of that blocked creature in its order is assigned lethal damage.) This turn-based action doesn\u2019t use the stack.\n509.3a During the declare blockers step, if an attacking creature is removed from combat or a spell or ability causes it to stop being blocked by a blocking creature, the attacking creature is removed from all relevant damage assignment orders. The relative order among the remaining attacking creatures is unchanged.\n509.4. Fourth, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, \u201cTiming and Priority.\u201d)\n509.4a Any abilities that triggered on blockers being declared or that triggered during the process described in rules 509.1\u20133 are put onto the stack before the active player gets priority; the order in which they triggered doesn\u2019t matter. (See rule 603, \u201cHandling Triggered Abilities.\u201d)\n509.5. Triggered abilities that trigger on blockers being declared may have different trigger conditions.\n509.5a An ability that reads \u201cWhenever [a creature] blocks, . . .\u201d generally triggers only once each combat for that creature, even if it blocks multiple creatures. It triggers if the creature is declared as a blocker. It will also trigger if that creature becomes a blocker as the result of an effect, but only if it wasn\u2019t a blocking creature at that time. (See rule 509.1g.) It won\u2019t trigger if the creature is put onto the battlefield blocking.\n509.5b An ability that reads \u201cWhenever [a creature] blocks a creature, . . .\u201d triggers once for each attacking creature the creature with the ability blocks. It triggers if the creature is declared as a blocker. It will also trigger if an effect causes that creature to block an attacking creature, but only if it wasn\u2019t already blocking that attacking creature at that time. It won\u2019t trigger if the creature is put onto the battlefield blocking.\n509.5c An ability that reads \u201cWhenever [a creature] becomes blocked, . . .\u201d generally triggers only once each combat for that creature, even if it\u2019s blocked by multiple creatures. It will trigger if that creature becomes blocked by at least one creature declared as a blocker. It will also trigger if that creature becomes blocked by an effect or by a creature that\u2019s put onto the battlefield as a blocker, but only if the attacking creature was an unblocked creature at that time. (See rule 509.1h.)\n509.5d An ability that reads \u201cWhenever [a creature] becomes blocked by a creature, . . .\u201d triggers once for each creature that blocks the named creature. It triggers if a creature is declared as a blocker for the attacking creature. It will also trigger if an effect causes a creature to block the attacking creature, but only if it wasn\u2019t already blocking that attacking creature at that time. In addition, it will trigger if a creature is put onto the battlefield blocking that creature. It won\u2019t trigger if the creature becomes blocked by an effect rather than a creature.\n509.5e If an ability triggers when a creature blocks or becomes blocked by a particular number of creatures, the ability triggers if the creature blocks or is blocked by that many creatures when blockers are declared. Effects that add or remove blockers can also cause such abilities to trigger. This applies to abilities that trigger on a creature blocking or being blocked by at least a certain number of creatures as well.\n509.5f If an ability triggers when a creature with certain characteristics blocks, it will trigger only if the creature has those characteristics at the point blockers are declared, or at the point an effect causes it to block. If an ability triggers when a creature with certain characteristics becomes blocked, it will trigger only if the creature has those characteristics at the point it becomes a blocked creature. If an ability triggers when a creature becomes blocked by a creature with certain characteristics, it will trigger only if the latter creature has those characteristics at the point it becomes a blocking creature. None of those abilities will trigger if the relevant creature\u2019s characteristics change to match the ability\u2019s trigger condition later on.\n509.5g An ability that reads \u201cWhenever [a creature] attacks and isn\u2019t blocked, . . .\u201d triggers if no creatures are declared as blockers for that creature. It will trigger even if the creature was never declared as an attacker (for example, if it entered the battlefield attacking). It won\u2019t trigger if the attacking creature is blocked and then all its blockers are removed from combat.\n509.6. If a spell or ability causes a creature on the battlefield to block an attacking creature, the active player announces the blocking creature\u2019s placement in the attacking creature\u2019s damage assignment order. The relative order among the remaining blocking creatures is unchanged. Then the defending player announces the attacking creature\u2019s placement in the blocking creature\u2019s damage assignment order. The relative order among the remaining attacking creatures is unchanged. This is done as part of the blocking effect.\n509.7. If a creature is put onto the battlefield blocking, its controller chooses which attacking creature it\u2019s blocking as it enters the battlefield (unless the effect that put it onto the battlefield specifies what it\u2019s blocking), then the active player announces the new creature\u2019s placement in the blocked creature\u2019s damage assignment order. The relative order among the remaining blocking creatures is unchanged. A creature put onto the battlefield this way is \u201cblocking\u201d but, for the purposes of trigger events and effects, it never \u201cblocked.\u201d\n509.7a If the effect that puts a creature onto the battlefield blocking specifies it\u2019s blocking a certain creature and that creature is no longer attacking, the creature is put onto the battlefield but is never considered a blocking creature. The same is true if the controller of the creature that\u2019s put onto the battlefield blocking isn\u2019t a defending player for the specified attacking creature.\n509.7b A creature that\u2019s put onto the battlefield blocking isn\u2019t affected by requirements or restrictions that apply to the declaration of blockers.", "url": "/regras/cr/5/509/"}, "510.1.": {"doc": "510.1.", "title": "510.1.", "content": "510.1.

They are written as \u201c[Cost]: [Effect.] [Activation instructions (if any).]\u201d\n602.1a The activation cost is everything before the colon (:). An ability\u2019s activation cost must be paid by the player who is activating it.\n602.1b Some text after the colon of an activated ability states instructions that must be followed while activating that ability. Such text may state which players can activate that ability, may restrict when a player can activate the ability, or may define some aspect of the activation cost. This text is not part of the ability\u2019s effect. It functions at all times. If an activated ability has any activation instructions, they appear last, after the ability\u2019s effect.\n602.1c An activated ability is the only kind of ability that can be activated. If an object or rule refers to activating an ability without specifying what kind, it must be referring to an activated ability.\n602.1d Previously, the action of using an activated ability was referred to on cards as \u201cplaying\u201d that ability. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference so they now refer to \u201cactivating\u201d that ability.\n602.2. To activate an ability is to put it onto the stack and pay its costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect. Only an object\u2019s controller (or its owner, if it doesn\u2019t have a controller) can activate its activated ability unless the object specifically says otherwise. Activating an ability follows the steps listed below, in order. If, at any point during the activation of an ability, a player is unable to comply with any of those steps, the activation is illegal; the game returns to the moment before that ability started to be activated (see rule 723, \u201cHandling Illegal Actions\u201d). Announcements and payments can\u2019t be altered after they\u2019ve been made.\n602.2a The player announces that they are activating the ability. If an activated ability is being activated from a hidden zone, the card that has that ability is revealed. That ability is created on the stack as an object that\u2019s not a card. It becomes the topmost object on the stack. It has the text of the ability that created it, and no other characteristics. Its controller is the player who activated the ability. The ability remains on the stack until it\u2019s countered, it resolves, or an effect moves it elsewhere.\n602.2b The remainder of the process for activating an ability is identical to the process for casting a spell listed in rules 601.2b\u2013i. Those rules apply to activating an ability just as they apply to casting a spell. An activated ability\u2019s analog to a spell\u2019s mana cost (as referenced in rule 601.2f) is its activation cost.\n602.3. Some abilities specify that one of their controller\u2019s opponents does something the controller would normally do while it\u2019s being activated, such as choose a mode or choose targets. In these cases, the opponent does so when the ability\u2019s controller normally would do so.\n602.3a If there is more than one opponent who could make such a choice, the ability\u2019s controller decides which of those opponents will make the choice.\n602.3b If the ability instructs its controller and another player to do something at the same time as the ability is being activated, the ability\u2019s controller goes first, then the other player. This is an exception to rule 101.4.\n602.4. Activating an ability that alters costs won\u2019t affect spells and abilities that are already on the stack.\n602.5. A player can\u2019t begin to activate an ability that\u2019s prohibited from being activated.\n602.5a A creature\u2019s activated ability with the tap symbol ({T}) or the untap symbol ({Q}) in its activation cost can\u2019t be activated unless the creature has been under its controller\u2019s control since the start of their most recent turn. Ignore this rule for creatures with haste (see rule 702.10).\n602.5b If an activated ability has a restriction on its use (for example, \u201cActivate this ability only once each turn\u201d), the restriction continues to apply to that object even if its controller changes.\n602.5c If an object acquires an activated ability with a restriction on its use from another object, that restriction applies only to that ability as acquired from that object.

They are written as \u201c[When/Whenever/At] [trigger condition or event], [effect]. [Instructions (if any).]\u201d\n603.1a A triggered ability may include instructions after its effects that limit what the ability may target or state that it can\u2019t be countered. This text is not part of the ability\u2019s effect. It functions while the ability is on the stack.\n603.2. Whenever a game event or game state matches a triggered ability\u2019s trigger event, that ability automatically triggers. The ability doesn\u2019t do anything at this point.\n603.2a Because they aren\u2019t cast or activated, triggered abilities can trigger even when it isn\u2019t legal to cast spells and activate abilities. Effects that preclude abilities from being activated don\u2019t affect them.\n603.2b When a phase or step begins, all abilities that trigger \u201cat the beginning of\u201d that phase or step trigger.\n603.2c An ability triggers only once each time its trigger event occurs. However, it can trigger repeatedly if one event contains multiple occurrences.\n603.2d An ability may state that a triggered ability triggers additional times. In this case, rather than simply determining that such an ability has triggered, determine how many times it should trigger, then that ability triggers that many times. An effect that states that an ability triggers additional times doesn\u2019t invoke itself repeatedly and doesn\u2019t apply to other effects that affect how many times an ability triggers.\n603.2e Some trigger events use the word \u201cbecomes\u201d (for example, \u201cbecomes attached\u201d or \u201cbecomes blocked\u201d). These trigger only at the time the named event happens\u2014they don\u2019t trigger if that state already exists or retrigger if it persists. An ability that triggers when a permanent \u201cbecomes tapped\u201d or \u201cbecomes untapped\u201d doesn\u2019t trigger if the permanent enters the battlefield in that state.\n603.2f If a triggered ability\u2019s trigger condition is met, but the object with that triggered ability is at no time visible to all players, the ability does not trigger.\n603.2g An ability triggers only if its trigger event actually occurs. An event that\u2019s prevented or replaced won\u2019t trigger anything.\n603.3. Once an ability has triggered, its controller puts it on the stack as an object that\u2019s not a card the next time a player would receive priority. See rule 117, \u201cTiming and Priority.\u201d The ability becomes the topmost object on the stack. It has the text of the ability that created it, and no other characteristics. It remains on the stack until it\u2019s countered, it resolves, a rule causes it to be removed from the stack, or an effect moves it elsewhere.\n603.3a A triggered ability is controlled by the player who controlled its source at the time it triggered, unless it\u2019s a delayed triggered ability. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered ability, see rules 603.7d\u2013f.\n603.3b If multiple abilities have triggered since the last time a player received priority, each player, in APNAP order, puts triggered abilities they control on the stack in any order they choose. (See rule 101.4.) Then the game once again checks for and resolves state-based actions until none are performed, then abilities that triggered during this process go on the stack. This process repeats until no new state-based actions are performed and no abilities trigger. Then the appropriate player gets priority.\n603.3c If a triggered ability is modal, its controller announces the mode choice when putting the ability on the stack. If one of the modes would be illegal (due to an inability to choose legal targets, for example), that mode can\u2019t be chosen. If no mode is chosen, the ability is removed from the stack. (See rule 700.2.)\n603.3d The remainder of the process for putting a triggered ability on the stack is identical to the process for casting a spell listed in rules 601.2c\u2013d. If a choice is required when the triggered ability goes on the stack but no legal choices can be made for it, or if a rule or a continuous effect otherwise makes the ability illegal, the ability is simply removed from the stack.\n603.4. A triggered ability may read \u201cWhen/Whenever/At [trigger event], if [condition], [effect].\u201d When the trigger event occurs, the ability checks whether the stated condition is true. The ability triggers only if it is; otherwise it does nothing. If the ability triggers, it checks the stated condition again as it resolves. If the condition isn\u2019t true at that time, the ability is removed from the stack and does nothing. Note that this mirrors the check for legal targets. This rule is referred to as the \u201cintervening \u2018if\u2019 clause\u201d rule. (The word \u201cif\u201d has only its normal English meaning anywhere else in the text of a card; this rule only applies to an \u201cif\u201d that immediately follows a trigger condition.)\n603.5. Some triggered abilities\u2019 effects are optional (they contain \u201cmay,\u201d as in \u201cAt the beginning of your upkeep, you may draw a card\u201d). These abilities go on the stack when they trigger, regardless of whether their controller intends to exercise the ability\u2019s option or not. The choice is made when the ability resolves. Likewise, triggered abilities that have an effect \u201cunless\u201d something is true or a player chooses to do something will go on the stack normally; the \u201cunless\u201d part of the ability is dealt with when the ability resolves.\n603.6. Trigger events that involve objects changing zones are called \u201czone-change triggers.\u201d Many abilities with zone-change triggers attempt to do something to that object after it changes zones. During resolution, these abilities look for the object in the zone that it moved to. If the object is unable to be found in the zone it went to, the part of the ability attempting to do something to the object will fail to do anything. The ability could be unable to find the object because the object never entered the specified zone, because it left the zone before the ability resolved, or because it is in a zone that is hidden from a player, such as a library or an opponent\u2019s hand. (This rule applies even if the object leaves the zone and returns again before the ability resolves.) The most common zone-change triggers are enters-the-battlefield triggers and leaves-the-battlefield triggers.\n603.6a Enters-the-battlefield abilities trigger when a permanent enters the battlefield. These are written, \u201cWhen [this object] enters the battlefield, . . . \u201c or \u201cWhenever a [type] enters the battlefield, . . .\u201d Each time an event puts one or more permanents onto the battlefield, all permanents on the battlefield (including the newcomers) are checked for any enters-the-battlefield triggers that match the event.\n603.6b Continuous effects that modify characteristics of a permanent do so the moment the permanent is on the battlefield (and not before then). The permanent is never on the battlefield with its unmodified characteristics. Continuous effects don\u2019t apply before the permanent is on the battlefield, however (see rule 603.6d).\n603.6c Leaves-the-battlefield abilities trigger when a permanent moves from the battlefield to another zone, or when a phased-in permanent leaves the game because its owner leaves the game. These are written as, but aren\u2019t limited to, \u201cWhen [this object] leaves the battlefield, . . .\u201d or \u201cWhenever [something] is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, . . . .\u201d (See also rule 603.10.) An ability that attempts to do something to the card that left the battlefield checks for it only in the first zone that it went to. An ability that triggers when a card is put into a certain zone \u201cfrom anywhere\u201d is never treated as a leaves-the-battlefield ability, even if an object is put into that zone from the battlefield.\n603.6d Some permanents have text that reads \u201c[This permanent] enters the battlefield with . . . ,\u201d \u201cAs [this permanent] enters the battlefield . . . ,\u201d \u201c[This permanent] enters the battlefield as . . . ,\u201d or \u201c[This permanent] enters the battlefield tapped.\u201d Such text is a static ability\u2014not a triggered ability\u2014whose effect occurs as part of the event that puts the permanent onto the battlefield.\n603.6e Some Auras have triggered abilities that trigger on the enchanted permanent leaving the battlefield. These triggered abilities can find the new object that permanent card became in the zone it moved to; they can also find the new object the Aura card became in its owner\u2019s graveyard after state-based actions have been checked. See rule 400.7.\n603.7. An effect may create a delayed triggered ability that can do something at a later time. A delayed triggered ability will contain \u201cwhen,\u201d \u201cwhenever,\u201d or \u201cat,\u201d although that word won\u2019t usually begin the ability.\n603.7a Delayed triggered abilities are created during the resolution of spells or abilities, as the result of a replacement effect being applied, or as a result of a static ability that allows a player to take an action. A delayed triggered ability won\u2019t trigger until it has actually been created, even if its trigger event occurred just beforehand. Other events that happen earlier may make the trigger event impossible.\n603.7b A delayed triggered ability will trigger only once\u2014the next time its trigger event occurs\u2014unless it has a stated duration, such as \u201cthis turn.\u201d If its trigger event occurs more than once simultaneously and the ability doesn\u2019t have a stated duration, the controller of the delayed triggered ability chooses which event causes the ability to trigger.\n603.7c A delayed triggered ability that refers to a particular object still affects it even if the object changes characteristics. However, if that object is no longer in the zone it\u2019s expected to be in at the time the delayed triggered ability resolves, the ability won\u2019t affect it. (Note that if that object left that zone and then returned, it\u2019s a new object and thus won\u2019t be affected. See rule 400.7.)\n603.7d If a spell creates a delayed triggered ability, the source of that delayed triggered ability is that spell. The controller of that delayed triggered ability is the player who controlled that spell as it resolved.\n603.7e If an activated or triggered ability creates a delayed triggered ability, the source of that delayed triggered ability is the same as the source of that other ability. The controller of that delayed triggered ability is the player who controlled that other ability as it resolved.\n603.7f If a static ability generates a replacement effect which causes a delayed triggered ability to be created, the source of that delayed triggered ability is the object with that static ability. The controller of that delayed triggered ability is the same as the controller of that object at the time the replacement effect was applied.\n603.7g If a static ability allows a player to take an action and creates a delayed triggered ability if that player does so, the source of that delayed triggered ability is the object with that static ability. The controller of that delayed triggered ability is the same as the controller of that object at the time the action was taken.\n603.8. Some triggered abilities trigger when a game state (such as a player controlling no permanents of a particular card type) is true, rather than triggering when an event occurs. These abilities trigger as soon as the game state matches the condition. They\u2019ll go onto the stack at the next available opportunity. These are called state triggers. (Note that state triggers aren\u2019t the same as state-based actions.) A state-triggered ability doesn\u2019t trigger again until the ability has resolved, has been countered, or has otherwise left the stack. Then, if the object with the ability is still in the same zone and the game state still matches its trigger condition, the ability will trigger again.\n603.9. Some triggered abilities trigger specifically when a player loses the game. These abilities trigger when a player loses or leaves the game, regardless of the reason, unless that player leaves the game as the result of a draw. See rule 104.3.\n603.10. Normally, objects that exist immediately after an event are checked to see if the event matched any trigger conditions, and continuous effects that exist at that time are used to determine what the trigger conditions are and what the objects involved in the event look like. However, some triggered abilities are exceptions to this rule; the game \u201clooks back in time\u201d to determine if those abilities trigger, using the existence of those abilities and the appearance of objects immediately prior to the event. The list of exceptions is as follows:\n603.10a Some zone-change triggers look back in time. These are leaves-the-battlefield abilities, abilities that trigger when a card leaves a graveyard, and abilities that trigger when an object that all players can see is put into a hand or library.\n603.10b Abilities that trigger when a permanent phases out look back in time.\n603.10c Abilities that trigger specifically when an object becomes unattached look back in time.\n603.10d Abilities that trigger when a player loses control of an object look back in time.\n603.10e Abilities that trigger when a spell is countered look back in time.\n603.10f Abilities that trigger when a player loses the game look back in time.\n603.10g Abilities that trigger when a player planeswalks away from a plane look back in time.\n603.11. Some objects have a static ability that\u2019s linked to one or more triggered abilities. (See rule 607, \u201cLinked Abilities.\u201d) These objects combine the abilities into one paragraph, with the static ability first, followed by each triggered ability that\u2019s linked to it. A very few objects have triggered abilities which are written with the trigger condition in the middle of the ability, rather than at the beginning.\n603.12. A resolving spell or ability may allow or instruct a player to take an action and create a triggered ability that triggers \u201cwhen [a player] [does or doesn\u2019t]\u201d take that action or \u201cwhen [something happens] this way.\u201d These reflexive triggered abilities follow the rules for delayed triggered abilities (see rule 603.7), except that they\u2019re checked immediately after being created and trigger based on whether the trigger event or events occurred earlier during the resolution of the spell or ability that created them.

For a card, that means the values of the characteristics printed on that card. For a token or a copy of a spell or card, that means the values of the characteristics defined by the effect that created it. Then all applicable continuous effects are applied in a series of layers in the following order:\n613.1a Layer 1: Rules and effects that modify copiable values are applied.\n613.1b Layer 2: Control-changing effects are applied.\n613.1c Layer 3: Text-changing effects are applied. See rule 612, \u201cText-Changing Effects.\u201d\n613.1d Layer 4: Type-changing effects are applied. These include effects that change an object\u2019s card type, subtype, and/or supertype.\n613.1e Layer 5: Color-changing effects are applied.\n613.1f Layer 6: Ability-adding effects, keyword counters, ability-removing effects, and effects that say an object can\u2019t have an ability are applied.\n613.1g Layer 7: Power- and/or toughness-changing effects are applied.\n613.2. Within layer 1, apply effects in a series of sublayers in the order described below. Within each sublayer, apply effects in timestamp order (see rule 613.7). Note that dependency may alter the order in which effects are applied within a sublayer. (See rule 613.8.)\n613.2a Layer 1a: Copiable effects are applied. This includes copy effects (see rule 706, \u201cCopying Objects\u201d) and changes to an object\u2019s base characteristics determined by merging an object with a permanent (see rule 721, \u201cMerging with Permanents\u201d). \u201cAs . . . enters the battlefield\u201d and \u201cas . . . is turned face up\u201d abilities generate copiable effects if they set power and toughness, even if they also define other characteristics.\n613.2b Layer 1b: Face-down spells and permanents have their characteristics modified as defined in rule 707.2.\n613.2c After all rules and effects in layer 1 have been applied, the object\u2019s characteristics are its copiable values. (See rule 706.2.)\n613.3. Within layers 2\u20136, apply effects from characteristic-defining abilities first (see rule 604.3), then all other effects in timestamp order (see rule 613.7). Note that dependency may alter the order in which effects are applied within a layer. (See rule 613.8.)\n613.4. Within layer 7, apply effects in a series of sublayers in the order described below. Within each sublayer, apply effects in timestamp order. (See rule 613.7.) Note that dependency may alter the order in which effects are applied within a sublayer. (See rule 613.8.)\n613.4a Layer 7a: Effects from characteristic-defining abilities that define power and/or toughness are applied. See rule 604.3.\n613.4b Layer 7b: Effects that set power and/or toughness to a specific number or value are applied. Effects that refer to the base power and/or toughness of a creature apply in this layer.\n613.4c Layer 7c: Effects and counters that modify power and/or toughness (but don\u2019t set power and/or toughness to a specific number or value) are applied.\n613.4d Layer 7d: Effects that switch a creature\u2019s power and toughness are applied. Such effects take the value of power and apply it to the creature\u2019s toughness, and take the value of toughness and apply it to the creature\u2019s power.\n613.5. The application of continuous effects as described by the layer system is continually and automatically performed by the game. All resulting changes to an object\u2019s characteristics are instantaneous.\n613.6. If an effect should be applied in different layers and/or sublayers, the parts of the effect each apply in their appropriate ones. If an effect starts to apply in one layer and/or sublayer, it will continue to be applied to the same set of objects in each other applicable layer and/or sublayer, even if the ability generating the effect is removed during this process.\n613.7. Within a layer or sublayer, determining which order effects are applied in is usually done using a timestamp system. An effect with an earlier timestamp is applied before an effect with a later timestamp.\n613.7a A continuous effect generated by a static ability has the same timestamp as the object the static ability is on, or the timestamp of the effect that created the ability, whichever is later.\n613.7b A continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability receives a timestamp at the time it\u2019s created.\n613.7c Each counter receives a timestamp as it\u2019s put on an object or player. If that object or player already has a counter of that kind on it, each counter of that kind receives a new timestamp identical to that of the new counter.\n613.7d An object receives a timestamp at the time it enters a zone.\n613.7e An Aura, Equipment, or Fortification receives a new timestamp each time it becomes attached to an object or player.\n613.7f A permanent receives a new timestamp each time it turns face up or face down.\n613.7g A transforming double-faced permanent receives a new timestamp each time it transforms.\n613.7h A face-up plane card, phenomenon card, or scheme card receives a timestamp at the time it\u2019s turned face up.\n613.7i A face-up vanguard card receives a timestamp at the beginning of the game.\n613.7j A conspiracy card receives a timestamp at the beginning of the game. If it\u2019s face down, it receives a new timestamp at the time it turns face up.\n613.7k If two or more objects would receive a timestamp simultaneously, such as by entering a zone simultaneously or becoming attached simultaneously, their relative timestamps are determined in APNAP order (see rule 101.4). Objects controlled by the active player (or owned by the active player, if they have no controller) have an earlier relative timestamp in the order of that player\u2019s choice, followed by each other player in turn order.\n613.8. Within a layer or sublayer, determining which order effects are applied in is sometimes done using a dependency system. If a dependency exists, it will override the timestamp system.\n613.8a An effect is said to \u201cdepend on\u201d another if (a) it\u2019s applied in the same layer (and, if applicable, sublayer) as the other effect; (b) applying the other would change the text or the existence of the first effect, what it applies to, or what it does to any of the things it applies to; and (c) neither effect is from a characteristic-defining ability or both effects are from characteristic-defining abilities. Otherwise, the effect is considered to be independent of the other effect.\n613.8b An effect dependent on one or more other effects waits to apply until just after all of those effects have been applied. If multiple dependent effects would apply simultaneously in this way, they\u2019re applied in timestamp order relative to each other. If several dependent effects form a dependency loop, then this rule is ignored and the effects in the dependency loop are applied in timestamp order.\n613.8c After each effect is applied, the order of remaining effects is reevaluated and may change if an effect that has not yet been applied becomes dependent on or independent of one or more other effects that have not yet been applied.\n613.9. One continuous effect can override another. Sometimes the results of one effect determine whether another effect applies or what another effect does.\n613.10. Some continuous effects affect players rather than objects. For example, an effect might give a player protection from red. All such effects are applied in timestamp order after the determination of objects\u2019 characteristics. See also the rules for timestamp order and dependency (rules 613.7 and 613.8).\n613.11. Some continuous effects affect game rules rather than objects. For example, effects may modify a player\u2019s maximum hand size, or say that a creature must attack this turn if able.

Like prevention effects (see rule 615), replacement effects apply continuously as events happen\u2014they aren\u2019t locked in ahead of time. Such effects watch for a particular event that would happen and completely or partially replace that event with a different event. They act like \u201cshields\u201d around whatever they\u2019re affecting.\n614.1a Effects that use the word \u201cinstead\u201d are replacement effects. Most replacement effects use the word \u201cinstead\u201d to indicate what events will be replaced with other events.\n614.1b Effects that use the word \u201cskip\u201d are replacement effects. These replacement effects use the word \u201cskip\u201d to indicate what events, steps, phases, or turns will be replaced with nothing.\n614.1c Effects that read \u201c[This permanent] enters the battlefield with . . . ,\u201d \u201cAs [this permanent] enters the battlefield . . . ,\u201d or \u201c[This permanent] enters the battlefield as . . . \u201c are replacement effects.\n614.1d Continuous effects that read \u201c[This permanent] enters the battlefield . . .\u201d or \u201c[Objects] enter the battlefield . . .\u201d are replacement effects.\n614.1e Effects that read \u201cAs [this permanent] is turned face up . . . ,\u201d are replacement effects.\n614.2. Some replacement effects apply to damage from a source. See rule 609.7.\n614.3. There are no special restrictions on casting a spell or activating an ability that generates a replacement effect. Such effects last until they\u2019re used up or their duration has expired.\n614.4. Replacement effects must exist before the appropriate event occurs\u2014they can\u2019t \u201cgo back in time\u201d and change something that\u2019s already happened. Spells or abilities that generate these effects are often cast or activated in response to whatever would produce the event and thus resolve before that event would occur.\n614.5. A replacement effect doesn\u2019t invoke itself repeatedly; it gets only one opportunity to affect an event or any modified events that may replace that event.\n614.6. If an event is replaced, it never happens. A modified event occurs instead, which may in turn trigger abilities. Note that the modified event may contain instructions that can\u2019t be carried out, in which case the impossible instruction is simply ignored.\n614.7. If a replacement effect would replace an event, but that event never happens, the replacement effect simply doesn\u2019t do anything.\n614.7a If a source would deal 0 damage, it does not deal damage at all. Replacement effects that would increase the damage dealt by that source, or would have that source deal that damage to a different object or player, have no event to replace, so they have no effect.\n614.8. Regeneration is a destruction-replacement effect. The word \u201cinstead\u201d doesn\u2019t appear on the card but is implicit in the definition of regeneration. \u201cRegenerate [permanent]\u201d means \u201cThe next time [permanent] would be destroyed this turn, instead remove all damage marked on it and tap it. If it\u2019s an attacking or blocking creature, remove it from combat.\u201d Abilities that trigger from damage being dealt still trigger even if the permanent regenerates. See rule 701.15.\n614.9. Some effects replace damage dealt to one creature, planeswalker, or player with the same damage dealt to another creature, planeswalker, or player; such effects are called redirection effects. If either creature or planeswalker is no longer on the battlefield when the damage would be redirected, or is no longer a creature or planeswalker when the damage would be redirected, the effect does nothing. If damage would be redirected to or from a player who has left the game, the effect does nothing.\n614.10. An effect that causes a player to skip an event, step, phase, or turn is a replacement effect. \u201cSkip [something]\u201d is the same as \u201cInstead of doing [something], do nothing.\u201d Once a step, phase, or turn has started, it can no longer be skipped\u2014any skip effects will wait until the next occurrence.\n614.10a Anything scheduled for a skipped step, phase, or turn won\u2019t happen. Anything scheduled for the \u201cnext\u201d occurrence of something waits for the first occurrence that isn\u2019t skipped. If two effects each cause a player to skip their next occurrence, that player must skip the next two; one effect will be satisfied in skipping the first occurrence, while the other will remain until another occurrence can be skipped.\n614.10b Some effects cause a player to skip a step, phase, or turn, then take another action. That action is considered to be the first thing that happens during the next step, phase, or turn to actually occur.\n614.11. Some effects replace card draws. These effects are applied even if no cards could be drawn because there are no cards in the affected player\u2019s library.\n614.11a If an effect replaces a draw within a sequence of card draws, all actions required by the replacement are completed, if possible, before resuming the sequence.\n614.11b If an effect would have a player both draw a card and perform an additional action on that card, and the draw is replaced, the additional action is not performed on any cards that are drawn as a result of that replacement effect.\n614.12. Some replacement effects modify how a permanent enters the battlefield. (See rules 614.1c\u2013d.) Such effects may come from the permanent itself if they affect only that permanent (as opposed to a general subset of permanents that includes it). They may also come from other sources. To determine which replacement effects apply and how they apply, check the characteristics of the permanent as it would exist on the battlefield, taking into account replacement effects that have already modified how it enters the battlefield (see rule 616.1), continuous effects from the permanent\u2019s own static abilities that would apply to it once it\u2019s on the battlefield, and continuous effects that already exist and would apply to the permanent.\n614.12a If a replacement effect that modifies how a permanent enters the battlefield requires a choice, that choice is made before the permanent enters the battlefield.\n614.12b Some replacement effects cause a permanent to enter the battlefield with its controller\u2019s choice of one of two abilities, each marked with an anchor word and preceded by a bullet point. \u201c[Anchor word] \u2014 [ability]\u201d means \u201cAs long as [anchor word] was chosen as this permanent entered the battlefield, this permanent has [ability].\u201d The abilities preceded by anchor words are each linked to the ability that causes a player to choose between them. See rule 607, \u201cLinked Abilities.\u201d\n614.13. An effect that modifies how a permanent enters the battlefield may cause other objects to change zones.\n614.13a While applying an effect that modifies how a permanent enters the battlefield, you may have to choose a number of objects that will also change zones. You can\u2019t choose the object that will become that permanent or any other object entering the battlefield at the same time as that object.\n614.13b The same object can\u2019t be chosen to change zones more than once when applying replacement effects that modify how a single permanent enters the battlefield.\n614.14. An object may have one ability printed on it that generates a replacement effect which causes one or more cards to be exiled, and another ability that refers either to \u201cthe exiled cards\u201d or to cards \u201cexiled with [this object].\u201d These abilities are linked: the second refers only to cards in the exile zone that were put there as a direct result of the replacement event caused by the first. If another object gains a pair of linked abilities, the abilities will be similarly linked on that object. They can\u2019t be linked to any other ability, regardless of what other abilities the object may currently have or may have had in the past. See rule 607, \u201cLinked Abilities.\u201d\n614.15. Some replacement effects are not continuous effects. Rather, they are an effect of a resolving spell or ability that replace part or all of that spell or ability\u2019s own effect(s). Such effects are called self-replacement effects. The text creating a self-replacement effect is usually part of the ability whose effect is being replaced, but the text can be a separate ability, particularly when preceded by an ability word. When applying replacement effects to an event, self-replacement effects are applied before other replacement effects.\n614.16. Some replacement effects apply \u201cif an effect would create one or more tokens\u201d or \u201cif an effect would put one or more counters on a permanent.\u201d These replacement effects apply if the effect of a resolving spell or ability creates a token or puts a counter on a permanent, and they also apply if another replacement or prevention effect does so, even if the original event being modified wasn\u2019t itself an effect.\n614.17. Some effects state that something can\u2019t happen. These effects aren\u2019t replacement effects, but follow similar rules.\n614.17a \u201cCan\u2019t\u201d effects must exist before the appropriate event occurs\u2014they can\u2019t \u201cgo back in time\u201d and change something that\u2019s already happened.\n614.17b If an event can\u2019t happen, a player can\u2019t choose to pay a cost that includes that event.\n614.17c If an event can\u2019t happen, it can only be replaced by a self-replacement effect (see rule 614.15). Other replacement and/or prevention effects can\u2019t modify or replace it.\n614.17d Some \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d effects modify how a permanent enters the battlefield or whether it can enter the battlefield. Such effects may come from the permanent itself if they affect only that permanent (as opposed to a general subset of permanents that includes it). They may also come from other sources.

Keyword Actions", "title": "701. Keyword Actions", "content": "701.1. Most actions described in a card\u2019s rules text use the standard English definitions of the verbs within, but some specialized verbs are used whose meanings may not be clear. These \u201ckeywords\u201d are game terms; sometimes reminder text summarizes their meanings.\n701.2. Activate\n701.2a To activate an activated ability is to put it onto the stack and pay its costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect. Only an object\u2019s controller (or its owner, if it doesn\u2019t have a controller) can activate its activated ability unless the object specifically says otherwise. A player may activate an ability if they have priority. See rule 602, \u201cActivating Activated Abilities.\u201d\n701.3. Attach\n701.3a To attach an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to an object or player means to take it from where it currently is and put it onto that object or player. If something is attached to a permanent on the battlefield, it\u2019s customary to place it so that it\u2019s physically touching the permanent. An Aura, Equipment, or Fortification can\u2019t be attached to an object or player it couldn\u2019t enchant, equip, or fortify, respectively.\n701.3b If an effect tries to attach an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to an object or player it can\u2019t be attached to, the Aura, Equipment, or Fortification doesn\u2019t move. If an effect tries to attach an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to the object or player it\u2019s already attached to, the effect does nothing. If an effect tries to attach an object that isn\u2019t an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to another object or player, the effect does nothing and the first object doesn\u2019t move.\n701.3c Attaching an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification on the battlefield to a different object or player causes the Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to receive a new timestamp.\n701.3d To \u201cunattach\u201d an Equipment from a creature means to move it away from that creature so the Equipment is on the battlefield but is not equipping anything. It should no longer be physically touching any creature. If an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification that was attached to an object or player ceases to be attached to it, that counts as \u201cbecoming unattached [from that object or player]\u201d; this includes if that Aura, Equipment, or Fortification leaves the battlefield, the object leaves the zone it was in, or that player leaves the game.\n701.4. Cast\n701.4a To cast a spell is to take it from the zone it\u2019s in (usually the hand), put it on the stack, and pay its costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect. A player may cast a spell if they have priority. See rule 601, \u201cCasting Spells.\u201d\n701.4b To cast a card is to cast it as a spell.\n701.5. Counter\n701.5a To counter a spell or ability means to cancel it, removing it from the stack. It doesn\u2019t resolve and none of its effects occur. A countered spell is put into its owner\u2019s graveyard.\n701.5b The player who cast a countered spell or activated a countered ability doesn\u2019t get a \u201crefund\u201d of any costs that were paid.\n701.6. Create\n701.6a To create one or more tokens with certain characteristics, put the specified number of tokens with the specified characteristics onto the battlefield.\n701.6b If a replacement effect applies to a token being created, that effect applies before considering any continuous effects that will modify the characteristics of that token. If a replacement effect applies to a token entering the battlefield, that effect applies after considering any continuous effects that will modify the characteristics of that token.\n701.6c Previously, an effect that created tokens instructed a player to \u201cput [those tokens] onto the battlefield.\u201d Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference so they now \u201ccreate\u201d those tokens.\n701.7. Destroy\n701.7a To destroy a permanent, move it from the battlefield to its owner\u2019s graveyard.\n701.7b The only ways a permanent can be destroyed are as a result of an effect that uses the word \u201cdestroy\u201d or as a result of the state-based actions that check for lethal damage (see rule 704.5g) or damage from a source with deathtouch (see rule 704.5h). If a permanent is put into its owner\u2019s graveyard for any other reason, it hasn\u2019t been \u201cdestroyed.\u201d\n701.7c A regeneration effect replaces a destruction event. See rule 701.15, \u201cRegenerate.\u201d\n701.8. Discard\n701.8a To discard a card, move it from its owner\u2019s hand to that player\u2019s graveyard.\n701.8b By default, effects that cause a player to discard a card allow the affected player to choose which card to discard. Some effects, however, require a random discard or allow another player to choose which card is discarded.\n701.8c If a card is discarded, but an effect causes it to be put into a hidden zone instead of into its owner\u2019s graveyard without being revealed, all values of that card\u2019s characteristics are considered to be undefined. If a card is discarded this way to pay a cost that specifies a characteristic about the discarded card, that cost payment is illegal; the game returns to the moment before the cost was paid (see rule 723, \u201cHandling Illegal Actions\u201d).\n701.9. Double\n701.9a Doubling a creature\u2019s power and/or toughness creates a continuous effect. This effect modifies that creature\u2019s power and/or toughness but doesn\u2019t set those characteristics to a specific value. See rule 613.4c.\n701.9b To double a creature\u2019s power, that creature gets +X/+0, where X is that creature\u2019s power as the spell or ability that doubles its power resolves. Similarly, an effect that doubles a creature\u2019s toughness gives it +0/+X, where X is that creature\u2019s toughness. Doubling a creature\u2019s power and toughness gives it +X/+Y, where X is its power and Y is its toughness.\n701.9c If a creature\u2019s power is less than 0 when it\u2019s doubled, doubling that creature\u2019s power instead means that the creature gets -X/-0, where X is the difference between 0 and its power. Similarly, if its toughness is less than 0 when doubled, it gets -0/-X. If one characteristic\u2019s value is negative but the other isn\u2019t when both are doubled, it gets -X/+Y or +X/-Y, as appropriate.\n701.9d To double a player\u2019s life total, the player gains or loses an amount of life such that their new life total is twice its current value.\n701.9e To double the number of a kind of counters on a player or permanent, give that player or permanent as many of those counters as that player or permanent already has.\n701.9f To double the amount of a type of mana in a player\u2019s mana pool, that player adds an amount of mana of that type equal to the amount they already have.\n701.10. Exchange\n701.10a A spell or ability may instruct players to exchange something (for example, life totals or control of two permanents) as part of its resolution. When such a spell or ability resolves, if the entire exchange can\u2019t be completed, no part of the exchange occurs.\n701.10b When control of two permanents is exchanged, if those permanents are controlled by different players, each of those players simultaneously gains control of the permanent that was controlled by the other player. If, on the other hand, those permanents are controlled by the same player, the exchange effect does nothing.\n701.10c When life totals are exchanged, each player gains or loses the amount of life necessary to equal the other player\u2019s previous life total. Replacement effects may modify these gains and losses, and triggered abilities may trigger on them. A player who can\u2019t gain life can\u2019t be given a higher life total this way, and a player who can\u2019t lose life can\u2019t be given a lower life total this way (see rules 119.7\u20138).\n701.10d Some spells or abilities may instruct a player to exchange cards in one zone with cards in a different zone (for example, exiled cards and cards in a player\u2019s hand). These spells and abilities work the same as other \u201cexchange\u201d spells and abilities, except they can exchange the cards only if all the cards are owned by the same player, and they can exchange the cards even if one zone is empty.\n701.10e If a card in one zone is exchanged with a card in a different zone, and either of them is attached to an object, that card stops being attached to that object and the other card becomes attached to that object.\n701.10f If a spell or ability instructs a player to simply exchange two zones, and one of the zones is empty, the cards in the zones are still exchanged.\n701.10g A spell or ability may instruct a player to exchange two numerical values. In such an exchange, each value becomes equal to the previous value of the other. If either of those values is a life total, the affected player gains or loses the amount of life necessary to equal the other value. Replacement effects may modify this gain or loss, and triggered abilities may trigger on it. A player who can\u2019t gain life can\u2019t be given a higher life total this way, and a player who can\u2019t lose life can\u2019t be given a lower life total this way (see rules 119.7\u20138). If either of those values is a power or toughness, a continuous effect is created setting that power or toughness to the other value (see rule 613.4b). This rule does not apply to spells and abilities that switch a creature\u2019s power and toughness.\n701.11. Exile\n701.11a To exile an object, move it to the exile zone from wherever it is. See rule 406, \u201cExile.\u201d\n701.12. Fight\n701.12a A spell or ability may instruct a creature to fight another creature or it may instruct two creatures to fight each other. Each of those creatures deals damage equal to its power to the other creature.\n701.12b If a creature instructed to fight is no longer on the battlefield or is no longer a creature, no damage is dealt. If a creature is an illegal target for a resolving spell or ability that instructs it to fight, no damage is dealt.\n701.12c If a creature fights itself, it deals damage to itself equal to twice its power.\n701.12d The damage dealt when a creature fights isn\u2019t combat damage.\n701.13. Mill\n701.13a For a player to mill a number of cards, that player puts that many cards from the top of their library into their graveyard.\n701.13b A player can\u2019t mill a number of cards greater than the number of cards in their library. If given the choice to do so, they can\u2019t choose to take that action. If instructed to do so, they mill as many as possible. Similarly, the player can't pay a cost that includes milling a number of cards greater than the number of cards in their library.\n701.13c An effect that refers to the \u201cmilled card\u201d can find that card in the zone it moved to from the library, as long as that zone is a public zone.\n701.13d If an ability checks information about a single milled card but more than one card was milled, that ability refers to each of the milled cards. If that ability asks for any information about the milled card, such as a characteristic or converted mana cost, it gets multiple answers. If these answers are used to determine the value of a variable, the sum of the answers is used. If that ability performs any actions on \u201cthe\u201d card, it performs that action on each milled card. If that ability performs any actions on \u201ca\u201d card, the controller of the ability chooses which card is affected.\n701.14. Play\n701.14a To play a land means to put it onto the battlefield from the zone it\u2019s in (usually the hand). A player may play a land if they have priority, it\u2019s the main phase of their turn, the stack is empty, and they haven\u2019t played a land this turn. Playing a land is a special action (see rule 116), so it doesn\u2019t use the stack; it simply happens. Putting a land onto the battlefield as the result of a spell or ability isn\u2019t the same as playing a land. See rule 305, \u201cLands.\u201d\n701.14b To play a card means to play that card as a land or to cast that card as a spell, whichever is appropriate.\n701.14c Some effects instruct a player to \u201cplay\u201d with a certain aspect of the game changed, such as \u201cPlay with the top card of your library revealed.\u201d \u201cPlay\u201d in this sense means to play the Magic game.\n701.14d Previously, the action of casting a spell, or casting a card as a spell, was referred to on cards as \u201cplaying\u201d that spell or that card. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference so they now refer to \u201ccasting\u201d that spell or that card.\n701.14e Previously, the action of using an activated ability was referred to on cards as \u201cplaying\u201d that ability. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference so they now refer to \u201cactivating\u201d that ability.\n701.15. Regenerate\n701.15a If the effect of a resolving spell or ability regenerates a permanent, it creates a replacement effect that protects the permanent the next time it would be destroyed this turn. In this case, \u201cRegenerate [permanent]\u201d means \u201cThe next time [permanent] would be destroyed this turn, instead remove all damage marked on it and tap it. If it\u2019s an attacking or blocking creature, remove it from combat.\u201d\n701.15b If the effect of a static ability regenerates a permanent, it replaces destruction with an alternate effect each time that permanent would be destroyed. In this case, \u201cRegenerate [permanent]\u201d means \u201cInstead remove all damage marked on [permanent] and tap it. If it\u2019s an attacking or blocking creature, remove it from combat.\u201d\n701.15c Neither activating an ability that creates a regeneration shield nor casting a spell that creates a regeneration shield is the same as regenerating a permanent. Effects that say that a permanent can\u2019t be regenerated don\u2019t preclude such abilities from being activated or such spells from being cast; rather, they cause regeneration shields to not be applied.\n701.16. Reveal\n701.16a To reveal a card, show that card to all players for a brief time. If an effect causes a card to be revealed, it remains revealed for as long as necessary to complete the parts of the effect that card is relevant to. If the cost to cast a spell or activate an ability includes revealing a card, the card remains revealed from the time the spell or ability is announced until the time it leaves the stack. If revealing a card causes a triggered ability to trigger, the card remains revealed until that triggered ability leaves the stack. If that ability isn\u2019t put onto the stack the next time a player would receive priority, the card ceases to be revealed.\n701.16b Revealing a card doesn\u2019t cause it to leave the zone it\u2019s in.\n701.16c If cards in a player\u2019s library are shuffled or otherwise reordered, any revealed cards that are reordered stop being revealed and become new objects.\n701.16d Some effects instruct a player to look at one or more cards. Looking at a card follows the same rules as revealing a card, except that the card is shown only to the specified player.\n701.17. Sacrifice\n701.17a To sacrifice a permanent, its controller moves it from the battlefield directly to its owner\u2019s graveyard. A player can\u2019t sacrifice something that isn\u2019t a permanent, or something that\u2019s a permanent they don\u2019t control. Sacrificing a permanent doesn\u2019t destroy it, so regeneration or other effects that replace destruction can\u2019t affect this action.\n701.18. Scry\n701.18a To \u201cscry N\u201d means to look at the top N cards of your library, then put any number of them on the bottom of your library in any order and the rest on top of your library in any order.\n701.18b If a player is instructed to scry 0, no scry event occurs. Abilities that trigger whenever a player scries won\u2019t trigger.\n701.18c If multiple players scry at once, each of those players looks at the top cards of their library at the same time. Those players decide in APNAP order (see rule 101.4) where to put those cards, then those cards move at the same time.\n701.19. Search\n701.19a To search for a card in a zone, look at all cards in that zone (even if it\u2019s a hidden zone) and find a card that matches the given description.\n701.19b If a player is searching a hidden zone for cards with a stated quality, such as a card with a certain card type or color, that player isn\u2019t required to find some or all of those cards even if they\u2019re present in that zone.\n701.19c If a player is instructed to search a hidden zone for cards that match an undefined quality, that player may still search that zone but can\u2019t find any cards.\n701.19d If a player is searching a hidden zone simply for a quantity of cards, such as \u201ca card\u201d or \u201cthree cards,\u201d that player must find that many cards (or as many as possible, if the zone doesn\u2019t contain enough cards).\n701.19e If the effect that contains the search instruction doesn\u2019t also contain instructions to reveal the found card(s), then they\u2019re not revealed.\n701.19f If searching a zone is replaced with searching a portion of that zone, any other instructions that refer to searching the zone still apply. Any abilities that trigger on a library being searched will trigger.\n701.19g If an effect offers a player a choice to search a zone and take additional actions with the cards found, that player may choose to search even if the additional actions are illegal or impossible.\n701.19h An effect may instruct a player to search a library for one or more cards more than once before instructing a player to shuffle that library. This is the same as a single instruction for that player to search that library for all those cards. The player searches that library only once.\n701.19i If multiple players search at once, each of those players looks at the appropriate cards at the same time, then those players decide in APNAP order (see rule 101.4) which card to find.\n701.20. Shuffle\n701.20a To shuffle a library or a face-down pile of cards, randomize the cards within it so that no player knows their order.\n701.20b Some effects cause a player to search a library for a card or cards, shuffle that library, then put the found card or cards in a certain position in that library. Even though the found card or cards never leave that library, they aren\u2019t included in the shuffle. Rather, all the cards in that library except those are shuffled. Abilities that trigger when a library is shuffled will still trigger. See also rule 401, \u201cLibrary.\u201d\n701.20c If an effect would cause a player to shuffle one or more specific objects into a library, that library is shuffled even if none of those objects are in the zone they\u2019re expected to be in or an effect causes all of those objects to be moved to another zone or remain in their current zone.\n701.20d If an effect would cause a player to shuffle a set of objects into a library, that library is shuffled even if there are no objects in that set.\n701.20e If an effect causes a player to shuffle a library containing zero or one cards, abilities that trigger when a library is shuffled will still trigger.\n701.20f If two or more effects cause a library to be shuffled multiple times simultaneously, abilities that trigger when that library is shuffled will trigger that many times.\n701.20g If an effect would cause a player to shuffle a library at the same time that an object would be put into a certain position in that library, the result is a shuffled library that\u2019s randomized except that the object is in the specified position.\n701.21. Tap and Untap\n701.21a To tap a permanent, turn it sideways from an upright position. Only untapped permanents can be tapped.\n701.21b To untap a permanent, rotate it back to the upright position from a sideways position. Only tapped permanents can be untapped.\n701.22. Fateseal\n701.22a To \u201cfateseal N\u201d means to look at the top N cards of an opponent\u2019s library, then put any number of them on the bottom of that library in any order and the rest on top of that library in any order.\n701.23. Clash\n701.23a To clash, a player reveals the top card of their library. That player may then put that card on the bottom of their library.\n701.23b \u201cClash with an opponent\u201d means \u201cChoose an opponent. You and that opponent each clash.\u201d\n701.23c Each clashing player reveals the top card of their library at the same time. Then those players decide in APNAP order (see rule 101.4) where to put those cards, then those cards move at the same time.\n701.23d A player wins a clash if that player revealed a card with a higher converted mana cost than all other cards revealed in that clash.\n701.24. Planeswalk\n701.24a A player may planeswalk only during a Planechase game. Only the planar controller may planeswalk. See rule 901, \u201cPlanechase.\u201d\n701.24b To planeswalk is to put each face-up plane card and phenomenon card on the bottom of its owner\u2019s planar deck face down, then move the top card of your planar deck off that planar deck and turn it face up.\n701.24c A player may planeswalk as the result of the \u201cplaneswalking ability\u201d (see rule 901.8), because the owner of a face-up plane card or phenomenon card leaves the game (see rule 901.10), or because a phenomenon\u2019s triggered ability leaves the stack (see rule 704.6f). Abilities may also instruct a player to planeswalk.\n701.24d The plane card that\u2019s turned face up is the plane the player planeswalks to. The plane card that\u2019s turned face down or that leaves the game is the plane the player planeswalks away from. The same is true with respect to phenomena.\n701.25. Set in Motion\n701.25a Only a scheme card may be set in motion, and only during an Archenemy game. Only the archenemy may set a scheme card in motion. See rule 312, \u201cSchemes,\u201d and rule 904, \u201cArchenemy.\u201d\n701.25b To set a scheme in motion, move it off the top of your scheme deck if it\u2019s on top of your scheme deck and turn it face up if it isn\u2019t face up. That scheme is considered to have been set in motion even if neither of these actions was performed on it.\n701.25c Schemes may only be set in motion one at a time. If a player is instructed to set multiple schemes in motion, that player sets a scheme in motion that many times.\n701.26. Abandon\n701.26a Only a face-up ongoing scheme card may be abandoned, and only during an Archenemy game. See rule 312, \u201cSchemes,\u201d and rule 904, \u201cArchenemy.\u201d\n701.26b To abandon a scheme, turn it face down and put it on the bottom of its owner\u2019s scheme deck.\n701.27. Proliferate\n701.27a To proliferate means to choose any number of permanents and/or players that have a counter, then give each one additional counter of each kind that permanent or player already has.\n701.27b In a Two-Headed Giant game, poison counters are shared by the team. If more than one player on a team is chosen this way, only one of those players can be given an additional poison counter. The player who proliferates chooses which player that is. See rule 810, \u201cTwo-Headed Giant Variant.\u201d\n701.28. Transform\n701.28a To transform a permanent, turn it over so that its other face is up. Only permanents represented by transforming double-faced cards can transform. (See rule 711, \u201cDouble-Faced Cards.\u201d)\n701.28b Although transforming a permanent uses the same physical action as turning a permanent face up or face down, they are different game actions. Abilities that trigger when a permanent is turned face down won\u2019t trigger when that permanent transforms, and so on.\n701.28c If a spell or ability instructs a player to transform a permanent that isn\u2019t represented by a transforming double-faced card, nothing happens.\n701.28d If a spell or ability instructs a player to transform a permanent, and the face that permanent would transform into is represented by an instant or sorcery card face, nothing happens.\n701.28e Some triggered abilities trigger when an object \u201ctransforms into\u201d an object with a specified characteristic. Such an ability triggers if the object transforms and has the specified characteristic immediately after it transforms.\n701.28f If an activated or triggered ability of a permanent that isn\u2019t a delayed triggered ability of that permanent tries to transform it, the permanent transforms only if it hasn\u2019t transformed since the ability was put onto the stack. If a delayed triggered ability of a permanent tries to transform that permanent, the permanent transforms only if it hasn\u2019t transformed since that delayed triggered ability was created. In either case, if the permanent has already transformed, the instruction to transform is ignored.\n701.29. Detain\n701.29a Certain spells and abilities can detain a permanent. Until the next turn of the controller of that spell or ability, that permanent can\u2019t attack or block and its activated abilities can\u2019t be activated.\n701.30. Populate\n701.30a To populate means to choose a creature token you control and create a token that\u2019s a copy of that creature token.\n701.30b If you control no creature tokens when instructed to populate, you won\u2019t create a token.\n701.31. Monstrosity\n701.31a \u201cMonstrosity N\u201d means \u201cIf this permanent isn\u2019t monstrous, put N +1/+1 counters on it and it becomes monstrous.\u201d\n701.31b Monstrous is a designation that has no rules meaning other than to act as a marker that the monstrosity action and other spells and abilities can identify. Only permanents can be or become monstrous. Once a permanent becomes monstrous, it stays monstrous until it leaves the battlefield. Monstrous is neither an ability nor part of the permanent\u2019s copiable values.\n701.31c If a permanent\u2019s ability instructs a player to \u201cmonstrosity X,\u201d other abilities of that permanent may also refer to X. The value of X in those abilities is equal to the value of X as that permanent became monstrous.\n701.32. Vote\n701.32a Some spells and abilities instruct players to vote for one choice from a list of options to determine some aspect of the effect of that spell or ability. To vote, each player, starting with a specified player and proceeding in turn order, chooses one of those choices.\n701.32b The listed choices may be objects, words with no rules meaning that are each connected to a different effect, or other variables relevant to the resolution of the spell or ability.\n701.32c If the text of a spell or ability refers to \u201cvoting,\u201d it refers only to an actual vote, not to any spell or ability that involves the players making choices or decisions without using the word \u201cvote.\u201d\n701.32d If an effect gives a player multiple votes, those votes all happen at the same time the player would otherwise have voted.\n701.33. Bolster\n701.33a \u201cBolster N\u201d means \u201cChoose a creature you control with the least toughness or tied for least toughness among creatures you control. Put N +1/+1 counters on that creature.\u201d\n701.34. Manifest\n701.34a To manifest a card, turn it face down. It becomes a 2/2 face-down creature card with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost. Put that card onto the battlefield face down. That permanent is a manifested permanent as long as it remains face down. The effect defining its characteristics works while the card is face down and ends when it\u2019s turned face up.\n701.34b Any time you have priority, you may turn a manifested permanent you control face up. This is a special action that doesn\u2019t use the stack (see rule 116.2b). To do this, show all players that the card representing that permanent is a creature card and what that card\u2019s mana cost is, pay that cost, then turn the permanent face up. The effect defining its characteristics while it was face down ends, and it regains its normal characteristics. (If the card representing that permanent isn\u2019t a creature card or it doesn\u2019t have a mana cost, it can\u2019t be turned face up this way.)\n701.34c If a card with morph is manifested, its controller may turn that card face up using either the procedure described in rule 702.36e to turn a face-down permanent with morph face up or the procedure described above to turn a manifested permanent face up.\n701.34d If an effect instructs a player to manifest multiple cards from their library, those cards are manifested one at a time.\n701.34e If an effect instructs a player to manifest a card and a rule or effect prohibits the face-down object from entering the battlefield, that card isn\u2019t manifested. Its characteristics remain unmodified and it remains in its previous zone. If it was face up, it remains face up.\n701.34f If a manifested permanent that\u2019s represented by an instant or sorcery card would turn face up, its controller reveals it and leaves it face down. Abilities that trigger whenever a permanent is turned face up won\u2019t trigger.\n701.34g See rule 707, \u201cFace-Down Spells and Permanents,\u201d for more information.\n701.35. Support\n701.35a \u201cSupport N\u201d on a permanent means \u201cPut a +1/+1 counter on each of up to N other target creatures.\u201d \u201cSupport N\u201d on an instant or sorcery spell means \u201cPut a +1/+1 counter on each of up to N target creatures.\u201d\n701.36. Investigate\n701.36a \u201cInvestigate\u201d means \u201cCreate a colorless Clue artifact token with \u2018{2}, Sacrifice this artifact: Draw a card.\u2019\u201d\n701.37. Meld\n701.37a Meld is a keyword action that appears in an ability on one card in a meld pair. (See rule 712, \u201cMeld Cards.\u201d) To meld the two cards in a meld pair, put them onto the battlefield with their back faces up and combined. The resulting permanent is a single object represented by two cards.\n701.37b Only two cards belonging to the same meld pair can be melded. Tokens, cards that aren\u2019t meld cards, or meld cards that don\u2019t form a meld pair can\u2019t be melded.\n701.37c If an effect instructs a player to meld objects that can\u2019t be melded, they stay in their current zone.\n701.38. Goad\n701.38a Certain spells and abilities can goad a creature. Until the next turn of the controller of that spell or ability, that creature attacks each combat if able and attacks a player other than that player if able.\n701.38b A static ability may state that a creature \u201cis goaded.\u201d That creature attacks each combat if able and attacks a player other than the controller of the permanent with that static ability if able.\n701.38c Once a player has goaded a creature, the same player goading it again has no effect. It doesn\u2019t create additional combat requirements.\n701.39. Exert\n701.39a To exert a permanent, you choose to have it not untap during your next untap step.\n701.39b A permanent can be exerted even if it\u2019s not tapped or has already been exerted in a turn. If you exert a permanent more than once before your next untap step, each effect causing it not to untap expires during the same untap step.\n701.39c An object that isn\u2019t on the battlefield can\u2019t be exerted.\n701.39d \u201cYou may exert [this creature] as it attacks\u201d is an optional cost to attack (see rule 508.1g). Some objects with this static ability have a triggered ability that triggers \u201cwhen you do\u201d printed in the same paragraph. These abilities are linked. (See rule 607.2g.)\n701.40. Explore\n701.40a Certain abilities instruct a permanent to explore. To do so, that permanent\u2019s controller reveals the top card of their library. If a land card is revealed this way, that player puts that card into their hand. Otherwise, that player puts a +1/+1 counter on the exploring permanent and may put the revealed card into their graveyard.\n701.40b A permanent \u201cexplores\u201d after the process described in rule 701.40a is complete, even if some or all of those actions were impossible.\n701.40c If a permanent changes zones before an effect causes it to explore, its last known information is used to determine which object explored and who controlled it.\n701.41. Assemble\n701.41a Assemble is a keyword action in the Unstable set that puts Contraptions onto the battlefield. Outside of silver-bordered cards, only one card (Steamflogger Boss) refers to assembling a Contraption. Cards and mechanics from the Unstable set aren\u2019t included in these rules. See the Unstable FAQ for more information.\n701.42. Surveil\n701.42a To \u201csurveil N\u201d means to look at the top N cards of your library, then put any number of them into your graveyard and the rest on top of your library in any order.\n701.42b If an effect allows you to look at additional cards while you surveil, those cards are included among the cards you may put into your graveyard and on top of your library in any order.\n701.43. Adapt\n701.43a \u201cAdapt N\u201d means \u201cIf this permanent has no +1/+1 counters on it, put N +1/+1 counters on it.\u201d\n701.44. Amass\n701.44a To amass N means \u201cIf you don\u2019t control an Army creature, create a 0/0 black Zombie Army creature token. Choose an Army creature you control. Put N +1/+1 counters on that creature.\u201d\n701.44b The phrase \u201cthe [subtype] you amassed\u201d refers to the creature you chose, whether or not it received counters.", "url": "/regras/cr/7/701/"}, "702.1.": {"doc": "702.1.", "title": "702.1.", "content": "702.1.

Defender\n702.3a Defender is a static ability.\n702.3b A creature with defender can\u2019t attack.\n702.3c Multiple instances of defender on the same creature are redundant.\n702.4. Double Strike\n702.4a Double strike is a static ability that modifies the rules for the combat damage step. (See rule 510, \u201cCombat Damage Step.\u201d)\n702.4b If at least one attacking or blocking creature has first strike (see rule 702.7) or double strike as the combat damage step begins, the only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are those with first strike or double strike. After that step, instead of proceeding to the end of combat step, the phase gets a second combat damage step. The only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are the remaining attackers and blockers that had neither first strike nor double strike as the first combat damage step began, as well as the remaining attackers and blockers that currently have double strike. After that step, the phase proceeds to the end of combat step.\n702.4c Removing double strike from a creature during the first combat damage step will stop it from assigning combat damage in the second combat damage step.\n702.4d Giving double strike to a creature with first strike after it has already dealt combat damage in the first combat damage step will allow the creature to assign combat damage in the second combat damage step.\n702.4e Multiple instances of double strike on the same creature are redundant.\n702.5. Enchant\n702.5a Enchant is a static ability, written \u201cEnchant [object or player].\u201d The enchant ability restricts what an Aura spell can target and what an Aura can enchant.\n702.5b For more information about Auras, see rule 303, \u201cEnchantments.\u201d\n702.5c If an Aura has multiple instances of enchant, all of them apply. The Aura\u2019s target must follow the restrictions from all the instances of enchant. The Aura can enchant only objects or players that match all of its enchant abilities.\n702.5d Auras that can enchant a player can target and be attached to players. Such Auras can\u2019t target permanents and can\u2019t be attached to permanents.\n702.6. Equip\n702.6a Equip is an activated ability of Equipment cards. \u201cEquip [cost]\u201d means \u201c[Cost]: Attach this permanent to target creature you control. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery.\u201d\n702.6b For more information about Equipment, see rule 301, \u201cArtifacts.\u201d\n702.6c \u201cEquip [quality] creature\u201d is a variant of the equip ability. \u201cEquip [quality] [cost]\u201d means \u201c[Cost]: Attach this permanent to target [quality] creature you control. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery.\u201d This ability doesn\u2019t restrict what the Equipment may be attached to.\n702.6d An \u201cequip [quality] creature\u201d ability is an equip ability, and an \u201cequip [quality] creature\u201d cost is an equip cost. Any effect that modifies how or whether a player may activate an equip ability of an object affects \u201cequip [quality] creature\u201d abilities of that object. Any effect that increases or reduces an equip cost will increase or reduce a \u201cequip [quality] creature\u201d cost.\n702.6e If a permanent has multiple equip abilities, any of its equip abilities may be activated.\n702.7. First Strike\n702.7a First strike is a static ability that modifies the rules for the combat damage step. (See rule 510, \u201cCombat Damage Step.\u201d)\n702.7b If at least one attacking or blocking creature has first strike or double strike (see rule 702.4) as the combat damage step begins, the only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are those with first strike or double strike. After that step, instead of proceeding to the end of combat step, the phase gets a second combat damage step. The only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are the remaining attackers and blockers that had neither first strike nor double strike as the first combat damage step began, as well as the remaining attackers and blockers that currently have double strike. After that step, the phase proceeds to the end of combat step.\n702.7c Giving first strike to a creature without it after combat damage has already been dealt in the first combat damage step won\u2019t preclude that creature from assigning combat damage in the second combat damage step. Removing first strike from a creature after it has already dealt combat damage in the first combat damage step won\u2019t allow it to also assign combat damage in the second combat damage step (unless the creature has double strike).\n702.7d Multiple instances of first strike on the same creature are redundant.\n702.8. Flash\n702.8a Flash is a static ability that functions in any zone from which you could play the card it\u2019s on. \u201cFlash\u201d means \u201cYou may play this card any time you could cast an instant.\u201d\n702.8b Multiple instances of flash on the same object are redundant.\n702.9. Flying\n702.9a Flying is an evasion ability.\n702.9b A creature with flying can\u2019t be blocked except by creatures with flying and/or reach. A creature with flying can block a creature with or without flying. (See rule 509, \u201cDeclare Blockers Step,\u201d and rule 702.17, \u201cReach.\u201d)\n702.9c Multiple instances of flying on the same creature are redundant.\n702.10. Haste\n702.10a Haste is a static ability.\n702.10b If a creature has haste, it can attack even if it hasn\u2019t been controlled by its controller continuously since their most recent turn began. (See rule 302.6.)\n702.10c If a creature has haste, its controller can activate its activated abilities whose cost includes the tap symbol or the untap symbol even if that creature hasn\u2019t been controlled by that player continuously since their most recent turn began. (See rule 302.6.)\n702.10d Multiple instances of haste on the same creature are redundant.\n702.11. Hexproof\n702.11a Hexproof is a static ability.\n702.11b \u201cHexproof\u201d on a permanent means \u201cThis permanent can\u2019t be the target of spells or abilities your opponents control.\u201d\n702.11c \u201cHexproof\u201d on a player means \u201cYou can\u2019t be the target of spells or abilities your opponents control.\u201d\n702.11d \u201cHexproof from [quality]\u201d is a variant of the hexproof ability. \u201cHexproof from [quality]\u201d on a permanent means \u201cThis permanent can\u2019t be the target of [quality] spells your opponents control or abilities your opponents control from [quality] sources.\u201d A \u201chexproof from [quality]\u201d ability is a hexproof ability.\n702.11e Any effect that causes an object to lose hexproof will cause an object to lose all \u201chexproof from [quality]\u201d abilities. Any effect that allows a player to choose a creature with hexproof as a target as though it didn\u2019t have hexproof will allow a player to choose a creature with a \u201chexproof from [quality]\u201d ability. Any effect that looks for a card with hexproof will find a card with a \u201chexproof from [quality]\u201d ability.\n702.11f \u201cHexproof from [quality A] and from [quality B]\u201d is shorthand for \u201chexproof from [quality A]\u201d and \u201chexproof from [quality B]\u201d; it behaves as two separate hexproof abilities. If an effect causes an object with such an ability to lose hexproof from [quality A], for example, that object would still have hexproof from [quality B].\n702.11g Multiple instances of the same hexproof ability on the same permanent or player are redundant.\n702.12. Indestructible\n702.12a Indestructible is a static ability.\n702.12b A permanent with indestructible can\u2019t be destroyed. Such permanents aren\u2019t destroyed by lethal damage, and they ignore the state-based action that checks for lethal damage (see rule 704.5g).\n702.12c Multiple instances of indestructible on the same permanent are redundant.\n702.13. Intimidate\n702.13a Intimidate is an evasion ability.\n702.13b A creature with intimidate can\u2019t be blocked except by artifact creatures and/or creatures that share a color with it. (See rule 509, \u201cDeclare Blockers Step.\u201d)\n702.13c Multiple instances of intimidate on the same creature are redundant.\n702.14. Landwalk\n702.14a Landwalk is a generic term that appears within an object\u2019s rules text as \u201c[type]walk,\u201d where [type] is usually a subtype, but can be the card type land, any land type, any supertype, or any combination thereof.\n702.14b Landwalk is an evasion ability.\n702.14c A creature with landwalk can\u2019t be blocked as long as the defending player controls at least one land with the specified subtype (as in \u201cislandwalk\u201d), with the specified supertype (as in \u201clegendary landwalk\u201d), without the specified supertype (as in \u201cnonbasic landwalk\u201d), or with both the specified supertype and the specified subtype (as in \u201csnow swampwalk\u201d). (See rule 509, \u201cDeclare Blockers Step.\u201d)\n702.14d Landwalk abilities don\u2019t \u201ccancel\u201d one another.\n702.14e Multiple instances of the same kind of landwalk on the same creature are redundant.\n702.15. Lifelink\n702.15a Lifelink is a static ability.\n702.15b Damage dealt by a source with lifelink causes that source\u2019s controller, or its owner if it has no controller, to gain that much life (in addition to any other results that damage causes). See rule 120.3.\n702.15c If a permanent leaves the battlefield before an effect causes it to deal damage, its last known information is used to determine whether it had lifelink.\n702.15d The lifelink rules function no matter what zone an object with lifelink deals damage from.\n702.15e If multiple sources with lifelink deal damage at the same time, they cause separate life gain events (see rules 119.9\u201310).\n702.15f Multiple instances of lifelink on the same object are redundant.\n702.16. Protection\n702.16a Protection is a static ability, written \u201cProtection from [quality].\u201d This quality is usually a color (as in \u201cprotection from black\u201d) but can be any characteristic value or information. If the quality happens to be a card name, it is treated as such only if the protection ability specifies that the quality is a name. If the quality is a card type, subtype, or supertype, the ability applies to sources that are permanents with that card type, subtype, or supertype and to any sources not on the battlefield that are of that card type, subtype, or supertype. This is an exception to rule 109.2.\n702.16b A permanent or player with protection can\u2019t be targeted by spells with the stated quality and can\u2019t be targeted by abilities from a source with the stated quality.\n702.16c A permanent or player with protection can\u2019t be enchanted by Auras that have the stated quality. Such Auras attached to the permanent or player with protection will be put into their owners\u2019 graveyards as a state-based action. (See rule 704, \u201cState-Based Actions.\u201d)\n702.16d A permanent with protection can\u2019t be equipped by Equipment that have the stated quality or fortified by Fortifications that have the stated quality. Such Equipment or Fortifications become unattached from that permanent as a state-based action, but remain on the battlefield. (See rule 704, \u201cState-Based Actions.\u201d)\n702.16e Any damage that would be dealt by sources that have the stated quality to a permanent or player with protection is prevented.\n702.16f Attacking creatures with protection can\u2019t be blocked by creatures that have the stated quality.\n702.16g \u201cProtection from [quality A] and from [quality B]\u201d is shorthand for \u201cprotection from [quality A]\u201d and \u201cprotection from [quality B]\u201d; it behaves as two separate protection abilities. If an effect causes an object with such an ability to lose protection from [quality A], for example, that object would still have protection from [quality B].\n702.16h \u201cProtection from all [characteristic]\u201d is shorthand for \u201cprotection from [quality A],\u201d \u201cprotection from [quality B],\u201d and so on for each possible quality the listed characteristic could have; it behaves as multiple separate protection abilities. If an effect causes an object with such an ability to lose protection from [quality A], for example, that object would still have protection from [quality B], [quality C], and so on.\n702.16i \u201cProtection from each [set of characteristics, qualities, or players]\u201d is shorthand for \u201cprotection from [A],\u201d \u201cprotection from [B],\u201d and so on for each characteristic, quality, or player in the set. It behaves as multiple separate protection abilities.\n702.16j \u201cProtection from everything\u201d is a variant of the protection ability. A permanent with protection from everything has protection from each object regardless of that object\u2019s characteristic values. Such a permanent can\u2019t be targeted by spells or abilities, enchanted by Auras, equipped by Equipment, fortified by Fortifications, or blocked by creatures, and all damage that would be dealt to it is prevented.\n702.16k \u201cProtection from [a player]\u201d is a variant of the protection ability. A permanent with protection from a specific player has protection from each object the player controls and protection from each object the player owns not controlled by another player, regardless of that object\u2019s characteristic values. Such a permanent can\u2019t be targeted by spells or abilities the player controls, enchanted by Auras the player controls, equipped by Equipment the player controls, fortified by Fortifications the player controls, or blocked by creatures the player controls, and all damage that would be dealt to it by sources controlled by the player or owned by the player but not controlled by another player is prevented.\n702.16m Multiple instances of protection from the same quality on the same permanent or player are redundant.\n702.16n Some Auras both give the enchanted creature protection from a quality and say \u201cthis effect doesn\u2019t remove\u201d either that specific Aura or all Auras. This means that the specified Auras aren\u2019t put into their owners\u2019 graveyards as a state-based action. If the creature has other instances of protection from the same quality, those instances affect Auras as normal.\n702.16p One Aura (Benevolent Blessing) gives the enchanted creature protection from a quality and says the effect doesn\u2019t remove certain permanents that are \u201calready attached to\u201d that creature. This means that any object with the stated quality attached to that creature at the moment the protection effect starts to apply (including the Aura giving the permanent protection) aren\u2019t put into their owners\u2019 graveyards as a state-based action. Other permanents with the stated quality can\u2019t become attached to the creature. If the creature has other instances of protection from the same quality, those instances affect attached permanents as normal.\n702.17. Reach\n702.17a Reach is a static ability.\n702.17b A creature with flying can\u2019t be blocked except by creatures with flying and/or reach. (See rule 509, \u201cDeclare Blockers Step,\u201d and rule 702.9, \u201cFlying.\u201d)\n702.17c Multiple instances of reach on the same creature are redundant.\n702.18. Shroud\n702.18a Shroud is a static ability. \u201cShroud\u201d means \u201cThis permanent or player can\u2019t be the target of spells or abilities.\u201d\n702.18b Multiple instances of shroud on the same permanent or player are redundant.\n702.19. Trample\n702.19a Trample is a static ability that modifies the rules for assigning an attacking creature\u2019s combat damage. The ability has no effect when a creature with trample is blocking or is dealing noncombat damage. (See rule 510, \u201cCombat Damage Step.\u201d)\n702.19b The controller of an attacking creature with trample first assigns damage to the creature(s) blocking it. Once all those blocking creatures are assigned lethal damage, any excess damage is assigned as its controller chooses among those blocking creatures and the player or planeswalker the creature is attacking. When checking for assigned lethal damage, take into account damage already marked on the creature and damage from other creatures that\u2019s being assigned during the same combat damage step, but not any abilities or effects that might change the amount of damage that\u2019s actually dealt. The attacking creature\u2019s controller need not assign lethal damage to all those blocking creatures but in that case can\u2019t assign any damage to the player or planeswalker it\u2019s attacking.\n702.19c If an attacking creature with trample is blocked, but there are no creatures blocking it when damage is assigned, all its damage is assigned to the player or planeswalker it\u2019s attacking.\n702.19d If a creature with trample is attacking a planeswalker, none of its combat damage can be assigned to the defending player, even if that planeswalker has been removed from combat or the damage the attacking creature could assign is greater than the planeswalker\u2019s loyalty.\n702.19e Multiple instances of trample on the same creature are redundant.\n702.20. Vigilance\n702.20a Vigilance is a static ability that modifies the rules for the declare attackers step.\n702.20b Attacking doesn\u2019t cause creatures with vigilance to tap. (See rule 508, \u201cDeclare Attackers Step.\u201d)\n702.20c Multiple instances of vigilance on the same creature are redundant.\n702.21. Banding\n702.21a Banding is a static ability that modifies the rules for combat.\n702.21b \u201cBands with other\u201d is a special form of banding. If an effect causes a permanent to lose banding, the permanent loses all \u201cbands with other\u201d abilities as well.\n702.21c As a player declares attackers, they may declare that one or more attacking creatures with banding and up to one attacking creature without banding (even if it has \u201cbands with other\u201d) are all in a \u201cband.\u201d They may also declare that one or more attacking [quality] creatures with \u201cbands with other [quality]\u201d and any number of other attacking [quality] creatures are all in a band. A player may declare as many attacking bands as they want, but each creature may be a member of only one of them. (Defending players can\u2019t declare bands but may use banding in a different way; see rule 702.21j.)\n702.21d All creatures in an attacking band must attack the same player or planeswalker.\n702.21e Once an attacking band has been announced, it lasts for the rest of combat, even if something later removes banding or \u201cbands with other\u201d from one or more of the creatures in the band.\n702.21f An attacking creature that\u2019s removed from combat is also removed from the band it was in.\n702.21g Banding doesn\u2019t cause attacking creatures to share abilities, nor does it remove any abilities. The attacking creatures in a band are separate permanents.\n702.21h If an attacking creature becomes blocked by a creature, each other creature in the same band as the attacking creature becomes blocked by that same blocking creature.\n702.21i If one member of a band would become blocked due to an effect, the entire band becomes blocked.\n702.21j During the combat damage step, if an attacking creature is being blocked by a creature with banding, or by both a [quality] creature with \u201cbands with other [quality]\u201d and another [quality] creature, the defending player (rather than the active player) chooses how the attacking creature\u2019s damage is assigned. That player can divide that creature\u2019s combat damage as they choose among any creatures blocking it. This is an exception to the procedure described in rule 510.1c.\n702.21k During the combat damage step, if a blocking creature is blocking a creature with banding, or both a [quality] creature with \u201cbands with other [quality]\u201d and another [quality] creature, the active player (rather than the defending player) chooses how the blocking creature\u2019s damage is assigned. That player can divide that creature\u2019s combat damage as they choose among any creatures it\u2019s blocking. This is an exception to the procedure described in rule 510.1d.\n702.21m Multiple instances of banding on the same creature are redundant. Multiple instances of \u201cbands with other\u201d of the same kind on the same creature are redundant.\n702.22. Rampage\n702.22a Rampage is a triggered ability. \u201cRampage N\u201d means \u201cWhenever this creature becomes blocked, it gets +N/+N until end of turn for each creature blocking it beyond the first.\u201d (See rule 509, \u201cDeclare Blockers Step.\u201d)\n702.22b The rampage bonus is calculated only once per combat, when the triggered ability resolves. Adding or removing blockers later in combat won\u2019t change the bonus.\n702.22c If a creature has multiple instances of rampage, each triggers separately.\n702.23. Cumulative Upkeep\n702.23a Cumulative upkeep is a triggered ability that imposes an increasing cost on a permanent. \u201cCumulative upkeep [cost]\u201d means \u201cAt the beginning of your upkeep, if this permanent is on the battlefield, put an age counter on this permanent. Then you may pay [cost] for each age counter on it. If you don\u2019t, sacrifice it.\u201d If [cost] has choices associated with it, each choice is made separately for each age counter, then either the entire set of costs is paid, or none of them is paid. Partial payments aren\u2019t allowed.\n702.23b If a permanent has multiple instances of cumulative upkeep, each triggers separately. However, the age counters are not connected to any particular ability; each cumulative upkeep ability will count the total number of age counters on the permanent at the time that ability resolves.\n702.24. Flanking\n702.24a Flanking is a triggered ability that triggers during the declare blockers step. (See rule 509, \u201cDeclare Blockers Step.\u201d) \u201cFlanking\u201d means \u201cWhenever this creature becomes blocked by a creature without flanking, the blocking creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn.\u201d\n702.24b If a creature has multiple instances of flanking, each triggers separately.\n702.25. Phasing\n702.25a Phasing is a static ability that modifies the rules of the untap step. During each player\u2019s untap step, before the active player untaps permanents, all phased-in permanents with phasing that player controls \u201cphase out.\u201d Simultaneously, all phased-out permanents that had phased out under that player\u2019s control \u201cphase in.\u201d\n702.25b If a permanent phases out, its status changes to \u201cphased out.\u201d Except for rules and effects that specifically mention phased-out permanents, a phased-out permanent is treated as though it does not exist. It can\u2019t affect or be affected by anything else in the game. A permanent that phases out is removed from combat. (See rule 506.4.)\n702.25c If a permanent phases in, its status changes to \u201cphased in.\u201d The game once again treats it as though it exists.\n702.25d The phasing event doesn\u2019t actually cause a permanent to change zones or control, even though it\u2019s treated as though it\u2019s not on the battlefield and not under its controller\u2019s control while it\u2019s phased out. Zone-change triggers don\u2019t trigger when a permanent phases in or out. Tokens continue to exist on the battlefield while phased out. Counters remain on a permanent while it\u2019s phased out. Effects that check a phased-in permanent\u2019s history won\u2019t treat the phasing event as having caused the permanent to leave or enter the battlefield or its controller\u2019s control.\n702.25e If a continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability modifies the characteristics or changes the controller of any objects, a phased-out permanent won\u2019t be included in the set of affected objects. This includes continuous effects that reference the permanent specifically, unless they also specifically refer to the permanent as phased out.\n702.25f Continuous effects that affect a phased-out permanent may expire while that permanent is phased out. If so, they will no longer affect that permanent once it\u2019s phased in. In particular, effects with \u201cfor as long as\u201d durations that track that permanent (see rule 611.2b) end when that permanent phases out because they can no longer see it.\n702.25g When a permanent phases out, any Auras, Equipment, or Fortifications attached to that permanent phase out at the same time. This alternate way of phasing out is known as phasing out \u201cindirectly.\u201d An Aura, Equipment, or Fortification that phased out indirectly won\u2019t phase in by itself, but instead phases in along with the permanent it\u2019s attached to.\n702.25h If an object would simultaneously phase out directly and indirectly, it just phases out indirectly.\n702.25i An Aura, Equipment, or Fortification that phased out directly will phase in attached to the object or player it was attached to when it phased out, if that object is still in the same zone or that player is still in the game. If not, that Aura, Equipment, or Fortification phases in unattached. State-based actions apply as appropriate. (See rules 704.5m and 704.5n.)\n702.25j Abilities that trigger when a permanent becomes attached or unattached from an object or player don\u2019t trigger when that permanent phases in or out.\n702.25k Phased-out permanents owned by a player who leaves the game also leave the game. This doesn\u2019t trigger zone-change triggers. See rule 800.4.\n702.25m If an effect causes a player to skip their untap step, the phasing event simply doesn\u2019t occur that turn.\n702.25n In a multiplayer game, game rules may cause a phased-out permanent to leave the game or to be exiled once a player leaves the game. (See rules 800.4a and 800.4c.) If a phased-out permanent phased out under the control of a player who has left the game, that permanent phases in during the next untap step after that player\u2019s next turn would have begun.\n702.25p Multiple instances of phasing on the same permanent are redundant.\n702.26. Buyback\n702.26a Buyback appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents two static abilities that function while the spell is on the stack. \u201cBuyback [cost]\u201d means \u201cYou may pay an additional [cost] as you cast this spell\u201d and \u201cIf the buyback cost was paid, put this spell into its owner\u2019s hand instead of into that player\u2019s graveyard as it resolves.\u201d Paying a spell\u2019s buyback cost follows the rules for paying additional costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f\u2013h.\n702.27. Shadow\n702.27a Shadow is an evasion ability.\n702.27b A creature with shadow can\u2019t be blocked by creatures without shadow, and a creature without shadow can\u2019t be blocked by creatures with shadow. (See rule 509, \u201cDeclare Blockers Step.\u201d)\n702.27c Multiple instances of shadow on the same creature are redundant.\n702.28. Cycling\n702.28a Cycling is an activated ability that functions only while the card with cycling is in a player\u2019s hand. \u201cCycling [cost]\u201d means \u201c[Cost], Discard this card: Draw a card.\u201d\n702.28b Although the cycling ability can be activated only if the card is in a player\u2019s hand, it continues to exist while the object is on the battlefield and in all other zones. Therefore objects with cycling will be affected by effects that depend on objects having one or more activated abilities.\n702.28c Some cards with cycling have abilities that trigger when they\u2019re cycled. \u201cWhen you cycle [this card]\u201d means \u201cWhen you discard [this card] to pay an activation cost of a cycling ability.\u201d These abilities trigger from whatever zone the card winds up in after it\u2019s cycled.\n702.28d Some cards have abilities that trigger whenever a player \u201ccycles or discards\u201d a card. These abilities trigger only once when a card is cycled.\n702.28e Typecycling is a variant of the cycling ability. \u201c[Type]cycling [cost]\u201d means \u201c[Cost], Discard this card: Search your library for a [type] card, reveal it, and put it into your hand. Then shuffle your library.\u201d This type is usually a subtype (as in \u201cmountaincycling\u201d) but can be any card type, subtype, supertype, or combination thereof (as in \u201cbasic landcycling\u201d).\n702.28f Typecycling abilities are cycling abilities, and typecycling costs are cycling costs. Any cards that trigger when a player cycles a card will trigger when a card is discarded to pay an activation cost of a typecycling ability. Any effect that stops players from cycling cards will stop players from activating cards\u2019 typecycling abilities. Any effect that increases or reduces a cycling cost will increase or reduce a typecycling cost. Any effect that looks for a card with cycling will find a card with typecycling.\n702.29. Echo\n702.29a Echo is a triggered ability. \u201cEcho [cost]\u201d means \u201cAt the beginning of your upkeep, if this permanent came under your control since the beginning of your last upkeep, sacrifice it unless you pay [cost].\u201d\n702.29b Urza block cards with the echo ability were printed without an echo cost. These cards have been given errata in the Oracle card reference; each one now has an echo cost equal to its mana cost.\n702.30. Horsemanship\n702.30a Horsemanship is an evasion ability.\n702.30b A creature with horsemanship can\u2019t be blocked by creatures without horsemanship. A creature with horsemanship can block a creature with or without horsemanship. (See rule 509, \u201cDeclare Blockers Step.\u201d)\n702.30c Multiple instances of horsemanship on the same creature are redundant.\n702.31. Fading\n702.31a Fading is a keyword that represents two abilities. \u201cFading N\u201d means \u201cThis permanent enters the battlefield with N fade counters on it\u201d and \u201cAt the beginning of your upkeep, remove a fade counter from this permanent. If you can\u2019t, sacrifice the permanent.\u201d\n702.32. Kicker\n702.32a Kicker is a static ability that functions while the spell with kicker is on the stack. \u201cKicker [cost]\u201d means \u201cYou may pay an additional [cost] as you cast this spell.\u201d Paying a spell\u2019s kicker cost(s) follows the rules for paying additional costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f\u2013h.\n702.32b The phrase \u201cKicker [cost 1] and/or [cost 2]\u201d means the same thing as \u201cKicker [cost 1], kicker [cost 2].\u201d\n702.32c Multikicker is a variant of the kicker ability. \u201cMultikicker [cost]\u201d means \u201cYou may pay an additional [cost] any number of times as you cast this spell.\u201d A multikicker cost is a kicker cost.\n702.32d If a spell\u2019s controller declares the intention to pay any of that spell\u2019s kicker costs, that spell has been \u201ckicked.\u201d If a spell has two kicker costs or has multikicker, it may be kicked multiple times. See rule 601.2b.\n702.32e Objects with kicker or multikicker have additional abilities that specify what happens if they are kicked. These abilities are linked to the kicker or multikicker abilities printed on that object: they can refer only to those specific kicker or multikicker abilities. See rule 607, \u201cLinked Abilities.\u201d\n702.32f Objects with more than one kicker cost have abilities that each correspond to a specific kicker cost. They contain the phrases \u201cif it was kicked with its [A] kicker\u201d and \u201cif it was kicked with its [B] kicker,\u201d where A and B are the first and second kicker costs listed on the card, respectively. Each of those abilities is linked to the appropriate kicker ability.\n702.32g If part of a spell\u2019s ability has its effect only if that spell was kicked, and that part of the ability includes any targets, the spell\u2019s controller chooses those targets only if that spell was kicked. Otherwise, the spell is cast as if it did not have those targets. See rule 601.2c.\n702.33. Flashback\n702.33a Flashback appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents two static abilities: one that functions while the card is in a player\u2019s graveyard and another that functions while the card is on the stack. \u201cFlashback [cost]\u201d means \u201cYou may cast this card from your graveyard by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost\u201d and \u201cIf the flashback cost was paid, exile this card instead of putting it anywhere else any time it would leave the stack.\u201d Casting a spell using its flashback ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f\u2013h.\n702.34. Madness\n702.34a Madness is a keyword that represents two abilities. The first is a static ability that functions while the card with madness is in a player\u2019s hand. The second is a triggered ability that functions when the first ability is applied. \u201cMadness [cost]\u201d means \u201cIf a player would discard this card, that player discards it, but exiles it instead of putting it into their graveyard\u201d and \u201cWhen this card is exiled this way, its owner may cast it by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost. If that player doesn\u2019t, they put this card into their graveyard.\u201d\n702.34b Casting a spell using its madness ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f\u2013h.\n702.34c After resolving a madness triggered ability, if the exiled card wasn\u2019t cast and was moved to a public zone, effects referencing the discarded card can find that card. See rule 400.7i.\n702.35. Fear\n702.35a Fear is an evasion ability.\n702.35b A creature with fear can\u2019t be blocked except by artifact creatures and/or black creatures. (See rule 509, \u201cDeclare Blockers Step.\u201d)\n702.35c Multiple instances of fear on the same creature are redundant.\n702.36. Morph\n702.36a Morph is a static ability that functions in any zone from which you could play the card it\u2019s on, and the morph effect works any time the card is face down. \u201cMorph [cost]\u201d means \u201cYou may cast this card as a 2/2 face-down creature with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost by paying {3} rather than paying its mana cost.\u201d (See rule 707, \u201cFace-Down Spells and Permanents.\u201d)\n702.36b Megamorph is a variant of the morph ability. \u201cMegamorph [cost]\u201d means \u201cYou may cast this card as a 2/2 face-down creature with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost by paying {3} rather than paying its mana cost\u201d and \u201cAs this permanent is turned face up, put a +1/+1 counter on it if its megamorph cost was paid to turn it face up.\u201d A megamorph cost is a morph cost.\n702.36c To cast a card using its morph ability, turn it face down. It becomes a 2/2 face-down creature card with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost. Any effects or prohibitions that would apply to casting a card with these characteristics (and not the face-up card\u2019s characteristics) are applied to casting this card. These values are the copiable values of that object\u2019s characteristics. (See rule 613, \u201cInteraction of Continuous Effects,\u201d and rule 706, \u201cCopying Objects.\u201d) Put it onto the stack (as a face-down spell with the same characteristics), and pay {3} rather than pay its mana cost. This follows the rules for paying alternative costs. You can use a morph ability to cast a card from any zone from which you could normally play it. When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield with the same characteristics the spell had. The morph effect applies to the face-down object wherever it is, and it ends when the permanent is turned face up.\n702.36d You can\u2019t normally cast a card face down. A morph ability allows you to do so.\n702.36e Any time you have priority, you may turn a face-down permanent you control with a morph ability face up. This is a special action; it doesn\u2019t use the stack (see rule 116). To do this, show all players what the permanent\u2019s morph cost would be if it were face up, pay that cost, then turn the permanent face up. (If the permanent wouldn\u2019t have a morph cost if it were face up, it can\u2019t be turned face up this way.) The morph effect on it ends, and it regains its normal characteristics. Any abilities relating to the permanent entering the battlefield don\u2019t trigger when it\u2019s turned face up and don\u2019t have any effect, because the permanent has already entered the battlefield.\n702.36f If a permanent\u2019s morph cost includes X, other abilities of that permanent may also refer to X. The value of X in those abilities is equal to the value of X chosen as the morph special action was taken.\n702.36g See rule 707, \u201cFace-Down Spells and Permanents,\u201d for more information about how to cast cards with a morph ability.\n702.37. Amplify\n702.37a Amplify is a static ability. \u201cAmplify N\u201d means \u201cAs this object enters the battlefield, reveal any number of cards from your hand that share a creature type with it. This permanent enters the battlefield with N +1/+1 counters on it for each card revealed this way. You can\u2019t reveal this card or any other cards that are entering the battlefield at the same time as this card.\u201d\n702.37b If a creature has multiple instances of amplify, each one works separately.\n702.38. Provoke\n702.38a Provoke is a triggered ability. \u201cProvoke\u201d means \u201cWhenever this creature attacks, you may choose to have target creature defending player controls block this creature this combat if able. If you do, untap that creature.\u201d\n702.38b If a creature has multiple instances of provoke, each triggers separately.\n702.39. Storm\n702.39a Storm is a triggered ability that functions on the stack. \u201cStorm\u201d means \u201cWhen you cast this spell, copy it for each other spell that was cast before it this turn. If the spell has any targets, you may choose new targets for any of the copies.\u201d\n702.39b If a spell has multiple instances of storm, each triggers separately.\n702.40. Affinity\n702.40a Affinity is a static ability that functions while the spell with affinity is on the stack. \u201cAffinity for [text]\u201d means \u201cThis spell costs you {1} less to cast for each [text] you control.\u201d\n702.40b If a spell has multiple instances of affinity, each of them applies.\n702.41. Entwine\n702.41a Entwine is a static ability of modal spells (see rule 700.2) that functions while the spell is on the stack. \u201cEntwine [cost]\u201d means \u201cYou may choose all modes of this spell instead of just the number specified. If you do, you pay an additional [cost].\u201d Using the entwine ability follows the rules for choosing modes and paying additional costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f\u2013h.\n702.41b If the entwine cost was paid, follow the text of each of the modes in the order written on the card when the spell resolves.\n702.42. Modular\n702.42a Modular represents both a static ability and a triggered ability. \u201cModular N\u201d means \u201cThis permanent enters the battlefield with N +1/+1 counters on it\u201d and \u201cWhen this permanent is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, you may put a +1/+1 counter on target artifact creature for each +1/+1 counter on this permanent.\u201d\n702.42b If a creature has multiple instances of modular, each one works separately.\n702.43. Sunburst\n702.43a Sunburst is a static ability that functions as an object is entering the battlefield. \u201cSunburst\u201d means \u201cIf this object is entering the battlefield as a creature, ignoring any type-changing effects that would affect it, it enters the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it for each color of mana spent to cast it. Otherwise, it enters the battlefield with a charge counter on it for each color of mana spent to cast it.\u201d\n702.43b Sunburst adds counters only if the object with sunburst is entering the battlefield from the stack as a resolving spell and only if one or more colored mana was spent on its costs, including additional or alternative costs.\n702.43c Sunburst can also be used to set a variable number for another ability. If the keyword is used in this way, it doesn\u2019t matter whether the ability is on a creature spell or on a noncreature spell.\n702.43d If an object has multiple instances of sunburst, each one works separately.\n702.44. Bushido\n702.44a Bushido is a triggered ability. \u201cBushido N\u201d means \u201cWhenever this creature blocks or becomes blocked, it gets +N/+N until end of turn.\u201d (See rule 509, \u201cDeclare Blockers Step.\u201d)\n702.44b If a creature has multiple instances of bushido, each triggers separately.\n702.45. Soulshift\n702.45a Soulshift is a triggered ability. \u201cSoulshift N\u201d means \u201cWhen this permanent is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, you may return target Spirit card with converted mana cost N or less from your graveyard to your hand.\u201d\n702.45b If a permanent has multiple instances of soulshift, each triggers separately.\n702.46. Splice\n702.46a Splice is a static ability that functions while a card is in your hand. \u201cSplice onto [quality] [cost]\u201d means \u201cYou may reveal this card from your hand as you cast a [quality] spell. If you do, that spell gains the text of this card\u2019s rules text and you pay [cost] as an additional cost to cast that spell.\u201d Paying a card\u2019s splice cost follows the rules for paying additional costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f\u2013h.\n702.46b You can\u2019t choose to use a splice ability if you can\u2019t make the required choices (targets, etc.) for that card\u2019s rules text. You can\u2019t splice any one card onto the same spell more than once. If you\u2019re splicing more than one card onto a spell, reveal them all at once and choose the order in which their effects will happen. The effects of the main spell must happen first.\n702.46c The spell has the characteristics of the main spell, plus the rules text of each of the spliced cards. This is a text-changing effect (see rule 612, \u201cText-Changing Effects\u201d). The spell doesn\u2019t gain any other characteristics (name, mana cost, color, supertypes, card types, subtypes, etc.) of the spliced cards. Text gained by the spell that refers to a card by name refers to the spell on the stack, not the card from which the text was copied.\n702.46d Choose targets for the added text normally (see rule 601.2c). Note that a spell with one or more targets won\u2019t resolve if all of its targets are illegal on resolution.\n702.46e The spell loses any splice changes once it leaves the stack for any reason.\n702.47. Offering\n702.47a Offering is a static ability that functions while the spell with offering is on the stack. \u201c[Subtype] offering\u201d means \u201cAs an additional cost to cast this spell, you may sacrifice a [subtype] permanent. If you chose to pay the additional cost, this spell\u2019s total cost is reduced by the sacrificed permanent\u2019s mana cost, and you may cast this spell any time you could cast an instant.\u201d\n702.47b You choose which permanent to sacrifice as you make choices for the spell (see rule 601.2b), and you sacrifice that permanent as you pay the total cost (see rule 601.2h).\n702.47c Generic mana in the sacrificed permanent\u2019s mana cost reduces generic mana in the spell\u2019s total cost. Colored and colorless mana in the sacrificed permanent\u2019s mana cost reduces mana of the same type in spell\u2019s total cost, and any excess reduces that much generic mana in spell\u2019s total cost. (See rule 118.7.)\n702.48. Ninjutsu\n702.48a Ninjutsu is an activated ability that functions only while the card with ninjutsu is in a player\u2019s hand. \u201cNinjutsu [cost]\u201d means \u201c[Cost], Reveal this card from your hand, Return an unblocked attacking creature you control to its owner\u2019s hand: Put this card onto the battlefield from your hand tapped and attacking.\u201d\n702.48b The card with ninjutsu remains revealed from the time the ability is announced until the ability leaves the stack.\n702.48c A ninjutsu ability may be activated only while a creature on the battlefield is unblocked (see rule 509.1h). The creature with ninjutsu is put onto the battlefield unblocked. It will be attacking the same player or planeswalker as the creature that was returned to its owner\u2019s hand.\n702.48d Commander ninjutsu is a variant of the ninjutsu ability that also functions while the card with commander ninjutsu is in the command zone. \u201cCommander ninjutsu [cost]\u201d means \u201c[Cost], Reveal this card from your hand or from the command zone, Return an unblocked attacking creature you control to its owner\u2019s hand: Put this card onto the battlefield tapped and attacking.\u201d\n702.49. Epic\n702.49a Epic represents two spell abilities, one of which creates a delayed triggered ability. \u201cEpic\u201d means \u201cFor the rest of the game, you can\u2019t cast spells,\u201d and \u201cAt the beginning of each of your upkeeps for the rest of the game, copy this spell except for its epic ability. If the spell has any targets, you may choose new targets for the copy.\u201d See rule 706.10.\n702.49b A player can\u2019t cast spells once a spell with epic they control resolves, but effects (such as the epic ability itself) can still put copies of spells onto the stack.\n702.50. Convoke\n702.50a Convoke is a static ability that functions while the spell with convoke is on the stack. \u201cConvoke\u201d means \u201cFor each colored mana in this spell\u2019s total cost, you may tap an untapped creature of that color you control rather than pay that mana.

If you can\u2019t, it remains exiled. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of the spell or the permanent it becomes.\u201d\n702.61b A card is \u201csuspended\u201d if it\u2019s in the exile zone, has suspend, and has a time counter on it.\n702.61c While determining if you could begin to cast a card with suspend, take into consideration any effects that would prohibit that card from being cast.\n702.61d Casting a spell as an effect of its suspend ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f\u2013h.\n702.62.

The second is a static ability that functions while the card with cipher is in the exile zone. \u201cCipher\u201d means \u201cIf this spell is represented by a card, you may exile this card encoded on a creature you control\u201d and \u201cFor as long as this card is encoded on that creature, that creature has \u2018Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, you may copy the encoded card and you may cast the copy without paying its mana cost.\u2019\u201d\n702.98b The term \u201cencoded\u201d describes the relationship between the card with cipher while in the exile zone and the creature chosen when the spell represented by that card resolves.\n702.98c The card with cipher remains encoded on the chosen creature as long as the card with cipher remains exiled and the creature remains on the battlefield. The card remains encoded on that object even if it changes controller or stops being a creature, as long as it remains on the battlefield.\n702.99. Evolve\n702.99a Evolve is a triggered ability. \u201cEvolve\u201d means \u201cWhenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, if that creature\u2019s power is greater than this creature\u2019s power and/or that creature\u2019s toughness is greater than this creature\u2019s toughness, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.\u201d\n702.99b A creature \u201cevolves\u201d when one or more +1/+1 counters are put on it as a result of its evolve ability resolving.\n702.99c A creature can\u2019t have a greater power or toughness than a noncreature permanent.\n702.99d If a creature has multiple instances of evolve, each triggers separately.\n702.100. Extort\n702.100a Extort is a triggered ability. \u201cExtort\u201d means \u201cWhenever you cast a spell, you may pay {W/B}. If you do, each opponent loses 1 life and you gain life equal to the total life lost this way.\u201d\n702.100b If a permanent has multiple instances of extort, each triggers separately.\n702.101. Fuse\n702.101a Fuse is a static ability found on some split cards (see rule 708, \u201cSplit Cards\u201d) that applies while the card with fuse is in a player\u2019s hand. If a player casts a split card with fuse from their hand, the player may choose to cast both halves of that split card rather than choose one half. This choice is made before putting the split card with fuse onto the stack. The resulting spell is a fused split spell.\n702.101b A fused split spell has the combined characteristics of its two halves. (See rule 708.4.)\n702.101c The total cost of a fused split spell includes the mana cost of each half.\n702.101d As a fused split spell resolves, the controller of the spell follows the instructions of the left half and then follows the instructions of the right half.\n702.102. Bestow\n702.102a Bestow represents a static ability that functions in any zone from which you could play the card it\u2019s on. \u201cBestow [cost]\u201d means \u201cAs you cast this spell, you may choose to cast it bestowed. If you do, you pay [cost] rather than its mana cost.\u201d Casting a spell using its bestow ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs (see 601.2b and 601.2f\u2013h).\n702.102b As a spell cast bestowed is put onto the stack, it becomes an Aura enchantment and gains enchant creature. It is a bestowed Aura spell, and the permanent it becomes as it resolves will be a bestowed Aura. These effects last until the spell or the permanent it becomes ceases to be bestowed (see rules 702.102d\u2013f). Because the spell is an Aura spell, its controller must choose a legal target for that spell as defined by its enchant creature ability and rule 601.2c. See also rule 303.4.\n702.102c When casting a spell bestowed, only its characteristics as modified by the bestow ability are evaluated to determine if it can be cast.\n702.102d As a bestowed Aura spell begins resolving, if its target is illegal, it ceases to be bestowed and the effect making it an Aura spell ends. It continues resolving as a creature spell and will be put onto the battlefield under the control of the spell\u2019s controller. This is an exception to rule 608.3a.\n702.102e If a bestowed Aura becomes unattached, it ceases to be bestowed. If a bestowed Aura is attached to an illegal object or player, it becomes unattached and ceases to be bestowed. This is an exception to rule 704.5m.\n702.102f If a bestowed Aura phases in unattached, it ceases to be bestowed. See rule 702.25, \u201cPhasing.\u201d\n702.103. Tribute\n702.103a Tribute is a static ability that functions as the creature with tribute is entering the battlefield. \u201cTribute N\u201d means \u201cAs this creature enters the battlefield, choose an opponent. That player may put an additional N +1/+1 counters on it as it enters the battlefield.\u201d\n702.103b Objects with tribute have triggered abilities that check \u201cif tribute wasn\u2019t paid.\u201d This condition is true if the opponent chosen as a result of the tribute ability didn\u2019t have the creature enter the battlefield with +1/+1 counters as specified by the creature\u2019s tribute ability.\n702.104. Dethrone\n702.104a Dethrone is a triggered ability. \u201cDethrone\u201d means \u201cWhenever this creature attacks the player with the most life or tied for most life, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.\u201d\n702.104b If a creature has multiple instances of dethrone, each triggers separately.\n702.105. Hidden Agenda\n702.105a Hidden agenda is a static ability that functions as a conspiracy card with hidden agenda is put into the command zone. \u201cHidden agenda\u201d means \u201cAs you put this conspiracy card into the command zone, turn it face down and secretly choose a card name.\u201d\n702.105b To secretly choose a card name, note that name on a piece of paper kept with the face-down conspiracy card.\n702.105c Any time you have priority, you may turn a face-down conspiracy card you control in the command zone face up. This is a special action. Doing so will reveal the chosen name. See rule 116.2i.\n702.105d Hidden agenda and another ability of the object with hidden agenda that refers to \u201cthe chosen name\u201d are linked. The second ability refers only to the card name chosen as a result of that object\u2019s hidden agenda ability. See rule 607.2d.\n702.105e If a player leaves the game, all face-down conspiracy cards controlled by that player must be revealed to all players. At the end of each game, all face-down conspiracy cards must be revealed to all players.\n702.105f Double agenda is a variant of the hidden agenda ability. As you put a conspiracy card with double agenda into the command zone, you secretly name two different cards rather than one. You don\u2019t reveal that more than one name was secretly chosen until you reveal the chosen names.\n702.106. Outlast\n702.106a Outlast is an activated ability. \u201cOutlast [cost]\u201d means \u201c[Cost], {T}: Put a +1/+1 counter on this creature. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery.\u201d\n702.107. Prowess\n702.107a Prowess is a triggered ability. \u201cProwess\u201d means \u201cWhenever you cast a noncreature spell, this creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.\u201d\n702.107b If a creature has multiple instances of prowess, each triggers separately.\n702.108. Dash\n702.108a Dash represents three abilities: two static abilities that function while the card with dash is on the stack, one of which may create a delayed triggered ability, and a static ability that functions while the object with dash is on the battlefield. \u201cDash [cost]\u201d means \u201cYou may cast this card by paying [cost] rather than its mana cost,\u201d \u201cIf this spell\u2019s dash cost was paid, return the permanent this spell becomes to its owner\u2019s hand at the beginning of the next end step,\u201d and \u201cAs long as this permanent\u2019s dash cost was paid, it has haste.\u201d Casting a spell for its dash cost follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f\u2013h.\n702.109. Exploit\n702.109a Exploit is a triggered ability. \u201cExploit\u201d means \u201cWhen this creature enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice a creature.\u201d\n702.109b A creature with exploit \u201cexploits a creature\u201d when the controller of the exploit ability sacrifices a creature as that ability resolves.\n702.110. Menace\n702.110a Menace is an evasion ability.\n702.110b A creature with menace can\u2019t be blocked except by two or more creatures. (See rule 509, \u201cDeclare Blockers Step.\u201d)\n702.110c Multiple instances of menace on the same creature are redundant.\n702.111. Renown\n702.111a Renown is a triggered ability. \u201cRenown N\u201d means \u201cWhen this creature deals combat damage to a player, if it isn\u2019t renowned, put N +1/+1 counters on it and it becomes renowned.\u201d\n702.111b Renowned is a designation that has no rules meaning other than to act as a marker that the renown ability and other spells and abilities can identify. Only permanents can be or become renowned. Once a permanent becomes renowned, it stays renowned until it leaves the battlefield. Renowned is neither an ability nor part of the permanent\u2019s copiable values.\n702.111c If a creature has multiple instances of renown, each triggers separately. The first such ability to resolve will cause the creature to become renowned, and subsequent abilities will have no effect. (See rule 603.4)\n702.112. Awaken\n702.112a Awaken appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents two abilities: a static ability that functions while the spell with awaken is on the stack and a spell ability. \u201cAwaken N\u2014[cost]\u201d means \u201cYou may pay [cost] rather than pay this spell\u2019s mana cost as you cast this spell\u201d and \u201cIf this spell\u2019s awaken cost was paid, put N +1/+1 counters on target land you control. That land becomes a 0/0 Elemental creature with haste. It\u2019s still a land.\u201d Casting a spell using its awaken ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f\u2013h.\n702.112b The controller of a spell with awaken chooses the target of the awaken spell ability only if that player chose to pay the spell\u2019s awaken cost. Otherwise the spell is cast as if it didn\u2019t have that target.\n702.113. Devoid\n702.113a Devoid is a characteristic-defining ability. \u201cDevoid\u201d means \u201cThis object is colorless.\u201d This ability functions everywhere, even outside the game.

Surge\n702.116a Surge is a static ability that functions while the spell with surge is on the stack. \u201cSurge [cost]\u201d means \u201cYou may pay [cost] rather than pay this spell\u2019s mana cost as you cast this spell if you or one of your teammates has cast another spell this turn.\u201d Casting a spell for its surge cost follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f\u2013h.\n702.117. Skulk\n702.117a Skulk is an evasion ability.\n702.117b A creature with skulk can\u2019t be blocked by creatures with greater power.

Partner\n702.123a Partner is an ability that modifies the rules for deck construction in the Commander variant (see rule 903), and it functions before the game begins. Rather than a single legendary creature card, you may designate two legendary creature cards as your commander if each has partner.\n702.123b Your deck must contain exactly 100 cards, including its two commanders. Both commanders begin the game in the command zone.\n702.123c A rule or effect that refers to your commander\u2019s color identity refers to the combined color identities of your two commanders. See rule 903.4.\n702.123d Except for determining the color identity of your commander, the two commanders function independently. When casting a commander with partner, ignore how many times your other commander has been cast (see rule 903.6). When determining whether a player has been dealt 21 or more combat damage by the same commander, consider damage from each of your two commanders separately (see rule 903.10a).\n702.123e If an effect refers to your commander while you have two commanders, it refers to either one. If an effect causes you to perform an action on your commander and it could affect both, you choose which it refers to at the time the effect is applied.\n702.123f \u201cPartner with [name]\u201d is a variant of the partner ability. \u201cPartner with [name]\u201d represents two abilities. One is a static ability that modifies the rules for deck construction. Rather than a single legendary creature card, you may designate two legendary creature cards as your commander if each has a \u201cpartner with [name]\u201d ability with the other\u2019s name. You can\u2019t designate two legendary cards as your commander if one has a \u201cpartner with [name]\u201d ability and the other isn\u2019t the named card. The other ability represented by \u201cpartner with [name]\u201d is a triggered ability that means \u201cWhen this permanent enters the battlefield, target player may search their library for a card named [name], reveal it, put it into their hand, then shuffle their library.\u201d\n702.124. Undaunted\n702.124a Undaunted is a static ability that functions while the spell with undaunted is on the stack.

It means \u201cIf you control ten or more permanents and you don\u2019t have the city\u2019s blessing, you get the city\u2019s blessing for the rest of the game.\u201d\n702.130b Ascend on a permanent represents a static ability. It means \u201cAny time you control ten or more permanents and you don\u2019t have the city\u2019s blessing, you get the city\u2019s blessing for the rest of the game.\u201d\n702.130c The city\u2019s blessing is a designation that has no rules meaning other than to act as a marker that other rules and effects can identify. Any number of players may have the city\u2019s blessing at the same time.\n702.130d After a player gets the city\u2019s blessing, continuous effects are reapplied before the game checks to see if the game state or preceding events have matched any trigger conditions.\n702.131. Assist\n702.131a Assist is a static ability that modifies the rules of paying for the spell with assist (see rules 601.2g-h). If the total cost to cast a spell with assist includes a generic mana component, before you activate mana abilities while casting it, you may choose another player. That player has a chance to activate mana abilities. Once that player chooses not to activate any more mana abilities, you have a chance to activate mana abilities. Before you begin to pay the total cost of the spell, the player you chose may pay for any amount of the generic mana in the spell\u2019s total cost.\n702.132. Jump-Start\n702.132a Jump-start appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents two static abilities: one that functions while the card is in a player\u2019s graveyard and another that functions while the card is on the stack. \u201cJump-start\u201d means \u201cYou may cast this card from your graveyard by discarding a card as an additional cost to cast it\u201d and \u201cIf this spell was cast using its jump-start ability, exile this card instead of putting it anywhere else any time it would leave the stack.\u201d Casting a spell using its jump-start ability follows the rules for paying additional costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f\u2013h.\n702.133. Mentor\n702.133a Mentor is a triggered ability. \u201cMentor\u201d means \u201cWhenever this creature attacks, put a +1/+1 counter on target attacking creature with power less than this creature\u2019s power.\u201d\n702.133b If a creature has multiple instances of mentor, each triggers separately.\n702.134.

Riot\n702.135a Riot is a static ability. \u201cRiot\u201d means \u201cYou may have this permanent enter the battlefield with an additional +1/+1 counter on it. If you don\u2019t, it gains haste.\u201d\n702.135b If a permanent has multiple instances of riot, each works separately.\n702.136.

Such a triggered ability triggers when that permanent enters the battlefield after its replacement effect was applied, even if that replacement effect had no effect.\n702.138. Companion\n702.138a Companion is a keyword ability that functions outside the game. It\u2019s written as \u201cCompanion\u2014[Condition].\u201d Before the game begins, you may reveal one card you own from outside the game with a companion ability whose condition is fulfilled by your starting deck. (See rule 103.2b.) Once during the game, any time you have priority and the stack is empty, but only during a main phase of your turn, you may pay {3} and put that card into your hand. This is a special action that doesn\u2019t use the stack (see rule 116.2g). This is a change from previous rules.\n702.138b If a companion ability refers to your starting deck, it refers to your deck after you\u2019ve set aside any sideboard cards. In a Commander game, this is also before you\u2019ve set aside your commander.\n702.138c Once you take the special action and put the card with companion into your hand, it remains in the game until the game ends.\n702.139. Mutate\n702.139a Mutate appears on some creature cards. It represents a static ability that functions while the spell with mutate is on the stack. \u201cMutate [cost]\u201d means \u201cYou may pay [cost] rather than pay this spell\u2019s mana cost. If you do, it becomes a mutating creature spell and targets a non-Human creature with the same owner as this spell.\u201d Casting a spell using its mutate ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs (see 601.2b and 601.2f\u2013h).\n702.139b As a mutating creature spell begins resolving, if its target is illegal, it ceases to be a mutating creature spell and continues resolving as a creature spell and will be put onto the battlefield under the control of the spell\u2019s controller.\n702.139c As a mutating creature spell resolves, if its target is legal, it doesn\u2019t enter the battlefield. Rather, it merges with the target creature and becomes one object represented by more than one card or token (see rule 721, \u201cMerging with Permanents\u201d). The spell\u2019s controller chooses whether the spell is put on top of the creature or on the bottom. The resulting permanent is a mutated permanent.\n702.139d An ability that triggers whenever a creature mutates triggers when a spell merges with a creature as a result of a resolving mutating creature spell.\n702.139e A mutated permanent has all abilities of each card and token that represents it. Its other characteristics are derived from the topmost card or token.\n702.139f Any effect that refers to or modifies the mutating creature spell refers to or modifies the mutated permanent it merges with as it resolves.\n702.140. Encore\n702.140a Encore is an activated ability that functions while the card with encore is in a graveyard. \u201cEncore [cost]\u201d means \u201c[Cost], Exile this card from your graveyard: For each opponent, create a token that\u2019s a copy of this card that attacks that opponent this turn if able. The tokens gain haste. Sacrifice them at the beginning of the next end step.

See rule 704.\n706.10b A copy of an ability has the same source as the original ability. If the ability refers to its source by name, the copy refers to that same object and not to any other object with the same name. The copy is considered to be the same ability by effects that count how many times that ability has resolved during the turn.\n706.10c Some effects copy a spell or ability and state that its controller may choose new targets for the copy. The player may leave any number of the targets unchanged, even if those targets would be illegal. If the player chooses to change some or all of the targets, the new targets must be legal. Once the player has decided what the copy\u2019s targets will be, the copy is put onto the stack with those targets.\n706.10d Some effects copy a spell or ability for each player or object it \u201ccould target.\u201d The copies are put onto the stack with those targets in the order of their controller\u2019s choice. If the spell or ability has more than one target, each of its targets must be the same player or object. If that player or object isn\u2019t a legal target for each instance of the word \u201ctarget,\u201d a copy isn\u2019t created for that player or object.\n706.10e Some effects copy a spell or ability and specify a new target for the copy. If the spell or ability has more than one target, each of the copy\u2019s targets must be that player or object. If that player or object isn\u2019t a legal target for each instance of the word \u201ctarget,\u201d the copy isn\u2019t created.\n706.10f Some effects copy a permanent spell. As that copy resolves, it ceases being a copy of a spell and becomes a token permanent. (See rule 608.3b.)\n706.11. If an effect refers to a permanent by name, the effect still tracks that permanent even if it changes names or becomes a copy of something else.\n706.12. An effect that instructs a player to cast a copy of an object (and not just copy a spell) follows the rules for casting spells, except that the copy is created in the same zone the object is in and then cast while another spell or ability is resolving. Casting a copy of an object follows steps 601.2a\u2013h of rule 601, \u201cCasting Spells,\u201d and then the copy becomes cast. Once cast, the copy is a spell on the stack, and just like any other spell it can resolve or be countered.", "url": "/regras/cr/7/706/"}, "707.1.": {"doc": "707.1.", "title": "707.1.", "content": "707.1.

Meld Cards", "title": "712. Meld Cards", "content": "712.1. A meld card has a Magic card face on one side and half of an oversized Magic card face on the other. It doesn\u2019t have a Magic card back.\n712.1a There are three specific meld pairs. Each meld pair consists of two specific cards whose back faces combine to form one oversized Magic card face: Midnight Scavengers and Graf Rats meld to form Chittering Host; Hanweir Garrison and Hanweir Battlements meld to form Hanweir, the Writhing Township; and Bruna, the Fading Light and Gisela, the Broken Blade meld to form Brisela, Voice of Nightmares.\n712.1b A meld card isn\u2019t a double-faced card. Its back face can\u2019t be cast or put onto the battlefield, and it can\u2019t transform or enter the battlefield transformed. (See rule 711, \u201cDouble-Faced Cards.\u201d)\n712.2. One card in each meld pair has an ability that exiles both that object and its counterpart and melds them. To meld the two cards in a meld pair, put them onto the battlefield with their back faces up and combined (see rule 701.37, \u201cMeld\u201d). The resulting permanent is a single object represented by two cards.\n712.3. The front face of each meld card and the combined face formed by a meld pair each has its own set of characteristics.\n712.3a While a meld card is outside the game, in a zone other than the battlefield, or on the battlefield with its front face up, it has only the characteristics of its front face.\n712.3b While the two cards of a meld pair are on the battlefield as a melded permanent, the object represented by those cards has only the characteristics of the combined back face, and its converted mana cost is the sum of the converted mana costs of its front faces. If a permanent is copying a melded permanent, the converted mana cost of the copy is 0. See rule 202.3c.\n712.3c Anything that needs information about a meld card or a melded permanent sees only the information given by the face that is currently up.\n712.4. If a melded permanent leaves the battlefield, one permanent leaves the battlefield and two cards are put into the appropriate zone.\n712.4a If a melded permanent is put into its owner\u2019s graveyard or library, that player may arrange the two cards in any order. If it\u2019s put into its owner\u2019s library, that player doesn\u2019t reveal the order.\n712.4b If a player exiles a melded permanent, that player determines the relative timestamp order of the two cards at that time. This is an exception to the procedure described in rule 613.7k.\n712.4c If an effect can find the new object that a melded permanent becomes as it leaves the battlefield, it finds both cards. (See rule 400.7.) If that effect causes actions to be taken upon those cards, the same actions are taken upon each of them.\n712.4d If multiple replacement effects could be applied to the event of a melded permanent leaving the battlefield or being put into the new zone, applying one of those replacement effects to one of the two cards affects both cards. If the melded permanent is a commander, it may be exempt from this rule; see rule 903.9a.\n712.4e If an effect needs to know the number of objects that changed zones, a melded permanent among those objects counts as one object that moved. If the effect needs to know the number of cards that changed zones, that melded permanent counts as two cards that moved.\n712.5. Players who are allowed to look at a meld card may look at its half of the combined back face. Players may access Oracle text for the other member of the meld pair and the combined face at any time (see rule 108.1).\n712.6. Meld cards in a player\u2019s deck may be represented by substitute cards. See rule 713, \u201cSubstitute Cards.\u201d\n712.7. If a meld card is cast as a spell, it\u2019s put on the stack with its front face up. See rule 601, \u201cCasting Spells.\u201d\n712.8. A meld card enters the battlefield with its front face up unless it\u2019s being melded with its counterpart.\n712.9. If an effect allows a player to cast a meld card as a face-down spell, or if a meld card enters the battlefield face down, it will have the characteristics given to it by the rule or effect that caused it to be face down. That card remains hidden, using either a face-down substitute card or opaque sleeves. See rule 707, \u201cFace-Down Spells and Permanents.\u201d\n712.10. Meld cards on the battlefield and melded permanents can\u2019t be turned face down. If a spell or ability tries to turn such a permanent face down, nothing happens.\n712.11.

Subgames", "content": "720.1. One card (Shahrazad) allows players to play a Magic subgame.\n720.1a A \u201csubgame\u201d is a completely separate Magic game created by an effect. Essentially, it\u2019s a game within a game. The \u201cmain game\u201d is the game in which the spell or ability that created the subgame was cast or activated. The main game is temporarily discontinued while the subgame is in progress. It resumes when the subgame ends.\n720.1b No effects or definitions created in either the main game or the subgame have any meaning in the other, except as defined by the effect that created the subgame. For example, the effect may say that something happens in the main game to the winner or loser of the subgame.\n720.2. As the subgame starts, an entirely new set of game zones is created. Each player takes all the cards in their main-game library, moves them to their subgame library, and shuffles them. No other cards in a main-game zone are moved to their corresponding subgame zone, except as specified in rules 720.2a\u2013d. Randomly determine which player goes first. The subgame proceeds like a normal game, following all other rules in rule 103, \u201cStarting the Game.\u201d\n720.2a As a subgame of a Planechase game starts, each player moves their planar deck from the main-game command zone to the subgame command zone and shuffles it. (Face-up plane and phenomenon cards remain in the main-game command zone.)\n720.2b As a subgame of a Vanguard game starts, each player moves their vanguard card from the main-game command zone to the subgame command zone.\n720.2c As a subgame of a Commander game starts, each player moves their commander from the main-game command zone (if it\u2019s there) to the subgame command zone.\n720.2d As a subgame of an Archenemy game starts, the archenemy moves their scheme deck from the main-game command zone to the subgame command zone and shuffles it. (Face-up scheme cards remain in the main-game command zone.)\n720.3. Because each player draws seven cards when a game begins, any player with fewer than seven cards in their deck will lose the subgame when state-based actions are checked during the upkeep step of the first turn, regardless of any mulligans that player takes. (See rule 704, \u201cState-Based Actions.\u201d)\n720.4. All objects in the main game and all cards outside the main game are considered outside the subgame (except those specifically brought into the subgame). All players not currently in the subgame are considered outside the subgame.\n720.4a Some effects can bring cards into a game from outside of it. If a card is brought into a subgame from a main game, abilities in the main game that trigger on objects leaving a main-game zone will trigger, but they won\u2019t be put onto the stack until the main game resumes.\n720.4b A player\u2019s main-game counters aren\u2019t considered part of the subgame, although the player will still have them when the main game resumes. Similarly, any counters a player gets during a subgame will cease to exist when the subgame ends.\n720.5. At the end of a subgame, each player takes all cards they own that are in the subgame other than those in the subgame command zone, puts them into their main-game library, then shuffles them. This includes cards in the subgame\u2019s exile zone. Except as specified in rules 720.5a\u2013d, all other objects in the subgame cease to exist, as do the zones created for the subgame. The main game continues from the point at which it was discontinued: First, the spell or ability that created the subgame finishes resolving, even if it was created by a spell card that\u2019s no longer on the stack. Then, if any main-game abilities triggered while the subgame was in progress due to cards being removed from the main game, those abilities are put onto the stack.\n720.5a At the end of a subgame of a Planechase game, each face-up plane card or phenomenon card is turned face down and put on the bottom of its owner\u2019s planar deck. Then each player moves their planar deck from the subgame command zone to the main-game command zone and shuffles it.\n720.5b At the end of a subgame of a Vanguard game, each player moves their vanguard card from the subgame command zone to the main-game command zone. This is an exception to rule 311.2.\n720.5c At the end of a subgame of a Commander game, each player moves their commander from the subgame command zone (if it\u2019s there) to the main-game command zone.\n720.5d At the end of a subgame of an Archenemy game, any face-up scheme cards in the subgame command zone are turned face down and put on the bottom of their owner\u2019s scheme deck.

Any ability that refers to the \u201cactive player\u201d refers to one specific active player, not to all of the active players. The ability\u2019s controller chooses which one the ability refers to at the time its effect is applied.\n805.10. The shared team turns option uses different combat rules than other multiplayer options.\n805.10a Each team\u2019s creatures attack the other team as a group. During the combat phase, the active team is the attacking team and each player on the active team is an attacking player. Likewise, the nonactive team is the defending team and each player on the nonactive team is a defending player.\n805.10b As the declare attackers step begins, the active team declares attackers. For each attacking creature, the attacking team announces which defending player or planeswalker that creature is attacking. The active team has one combined attack, and that set of attacking creatures must be legal as a whole. See rule 508.1.\n805.10c Any rule, object, or effect that refers to an \u201cattacking player\u201d refers to one specific attacking player, not to all attacking players. If an ability of a blocking creature refers to an attacking player, or a spell or ability refers to both a blocking creature and an attacking player, then unless otherwise specified, the attacking player it\u2019s referring to is the player who controls the attacking creature that blocking creature is blocking. If a spell or ability could apply to multiple blocking creatures, the appropriate attacking player is individually determined for each of those blocking creatures. If there are multiple attacking players that could be chosen, the controller of the spell or ability chooses one.\n805.10d As the declare blockers step begins, the defending team declares blockers. Creatures controlled by the defending players can block creatures attacking any player on the defending team or attacking a planeswalker controlled by one of those players. The defending team has one combined block, and that set of blocking creatures must be legal as a whole. See rule 509.1.\n805.10e Any rule, object, or effect that refers to a \u201cdefending player\u201d refers to one specific defending player, not to all of the defending players. If an ability of an attacking creature refers to a defending player, or a spell or ability refers to both an attacking creature and a defending player, then unless otherwise specified, the defending player it\u2019s referring to is the player that creature is attacking, or the controller of the planeswalker that creature is attacking. If that creature is no longer attacking, the defending player it\u2019s referring to is the player that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat or the controller of the planeswalker that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat. If a spell or ability could apply to multiple attacking creatures, the appropriate defending player is individually determined for each of those attacking creatures. If there are multiple defending players that could be chosen, the controller of the spell or ability chooses one.\n805.10f Once blockers have been declared, for each attacking creature that\u2019s become blocked by multiple creatures, the active team announces the damage assignment order among the blocking creatures. Then, for each creature that\u2019s blocking multiple creatures, the defending team announces the damage assignment order among the attacking creatures.\n805.10g As the combat damage step begins, the active team announces how each attacking creature will assign its combat damage. Then the defending team announces how each blocking creature will assign its combat damage.

The Planechase variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.\n901.2. A Planechase game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game. The default multiplayer setup is the Free-for-All variant with the attack multiple players option and without the limited range of influence option. See rule 806, \u201cFree-for-All Variant.\u201d\n901.3. In addition to the normal game materials, each player needs a planar deck of at least ten plane and/or phenomenon cards and the game needs one planar die. No more than two cards in a planar deck can be phenomenon cards. Each card in a planar deck must have a different English name. (See rule 309, \u201cPlanes,\u201d and rule 310, \u201cPhenomena.\u201d)\n901.3a A planar die is a six-sided die. One face has the Planeswalker symbol {PW}. One face has the chaos symbol {CHAOS}. The other faces are blank.\n901.4. At the start of the game, each player shuffles their planar deck so that the cards are in a random order. Each deck is placed face down next to its owner\u2019s library. All plane and phenomenon cards remain in the command zone throughout the game, both while they\u2019re part of a planar deck and while they\u2019re face up.\n901.5. Once all players have kept their opening hands and used the abilities of cards that allow them to take an action with those cards from their opening hands, the starting player moves the top card of their planar deck off that planar deck and turns it face up. If it\u2019s a phenomenon card, the player puts that card on the bottom of their planar deck and repeats this process until a plane card is turned face up. (See rule 103.6.) No abilities of any card turned face up this way trigger during this process. The face-up plane card becomes the starting plane.\n901.6. The owner of a plane or phenomenon card is the player who started the game with it in their planar deck. The controller of a face-up plane or phenomenon card is the player designated as the planar controller. Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn\u2019t leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.\n901.7. Any abilities of a face-up plane card or phenomenon card in the command zone function from that zone. The card\u2019s static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.\n901.7a A face-up plane card or phenomenon card that\u2019s turned face down becomes a new object.\n901.8. Planechase games have an inherent triggered ability known as the \u201cplaneswalking ability.\u201d The full text of this ability is \u201cWhenever you roll {PW}, planeswalk.\u201d (See rule 701.24, \u201cPlaneswalk.\u201d) This ability has no source and is controlled by the player whose planar die roll caused it to trigger. This is an exception to rule 113.8.\n901.9. Any time the active player has priority and the stack is empty, but only during a main phase of their turn, that player may roll the planar die. Taking this action costs a player an amount of mana equal to the number of times they have previously taken this action on that turn. This is a special action and doesn\u2019t use the stack. Note that this number won\u2019t be equal to the number of times the player has rolled the planar die that turn if an effect has caused the player to roll the planar die that turn. (See rule 116.2h.)\n901.9a If the die roll is a blank face, nothing happens. The active player gets priority.\n901.9b If the die roll is the chaos symbol {CHAOS}, any ability of a face-up plane that starts \u201cWhen you roll {CHAOS}\u201d triggers and is put on the stack. The active player gets priority.\n901.9c If the die roll is the Planeswalker symbol {PW}, the \u201cplaneswalking ability\u201d triggers and is put on the stack. The active player gets priority. (See rule 901.8.)\n901.10. When a player leaves the game, all objects owned by that player except abilities from phenomena leave the game. (See rule 800.4a.) If that includes a face-up plane card or phenomenon card, the planar controller turns the top card of their planar deck face up. This is not a state-based action. It happens as soon as the player leaves the game.\n901.10a If a plane leaves the game while a \u201cplaneswalking ability\u201d is on the stack, that ability ceases to exist.\n901.10b Abilities from phenomena owned by a player who left the game remain on the stack controlled by the new planar controller.\n901.11. After the game has started, if a player moves the top card of their planar deck off that planar deck and turns it face up, that player has \u201cplaneswalked.\u201d Continuous effects with durations that last until a player planeswalks end. Abilities that trigger when a player planeswalks trigger. See rule 701.24.\n901.11a A player may planeswalk as the result of the \u201cplaneswalking ability\u201d (see rule 901.8), because the owner of a face-up plane card or phenomenon card leaves the game (see rule 901.10), or because a phenomenon\u2019s triggered ability leaves the stack (see rule 704.6f). Abilities may also instruct a player to planeswalk.\n901.11b The plane card that\u2019s turned face up is the plane the player planeswalks to. The plane card or phenomenon card that\u2019s turned face down, or that leaves the game, is the plane or phenomenon the player planeswalks away from.\n901.11c If a player planeswalks when there is more than one face-up plane card, that player planeswalks away from all such planes.\n901.12. A Two-Headed Giant Planechase game uses all the rules for the Two-Headed Giant multiplayer variant and all the rules for the Planechase casual variant, with the following additions.\n901.12a Each player has their own planar deck.\n901.12b The planar controller is normally the primary player of the active team. However, if the current planar controller\u2019s team would leave the game, instead the primary player of the next team in turn order that wouldn\u2019t leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller\u2019s team leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different team becomes the active team, whichever comes first.\n901.12c Even though the face-up plane or phenomenon is controlled by just one player, any ability of that plane or phenomenon that refers to \u201cyou\u201d applies to both members of the planar controller\u2019s team.\n901.12d Since each member of the active team is an active player, each of them may roll the planar die. Each player\u2019s cost to roll the planar die is based on the number of times that particular player has already rolled the planar die that turn.\n901.13. In multiplayer formats other than Grand Melee, plane cards and phenomenon cards are exempt from the limited range of influence option. Their abilities, and the effects of those abilities, affect all applicable objects and players in the game. (See rule 801, \u201cLimited Range of Influence Option.\u201d)\n901.14. In Grand Melee Planechase games, multiple plane cards or phenomenon cards may be face up at the same time.\n901.14a Before the first turn of the game of the game, each player who will start the game with a turn marker sets a starting plane (see rule 901.5). Each of them is a planar controller.\n901.14b If a player would leave the game and that player leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game, that player first ceases to be a planar controller (but no other player becomes a planar controller), then that player leaves the game. Each face-up plane card or phenomenon card that player controlled is put on the bottom of its owner\u2019s planar deck. No player is considered to have planeswalked.\n901.15. Single Planar Deck Option\n901.15a As an alternative option, a Planechase game may be played with just a single communal planar deck. In that case, the number of cards in the planar deck must be at least forty or at least ten times the number of players in the game, whichever is smaller.

In the Commander variant, each deck is led by a legendary creature designated as that deck\u2019s commander. The Commander variant was created and popularized by fans; an independent rules committee maintains additional resources at MTGCommander.net. The Commander variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.\n903.2. A Commander game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game. The default multiplayer setup is the Free-for-All variant with the attack multiple players option and without the limited range of influence option. See rule 806, \u201cFree-for-All Variant.\u201d\n903.3. Each deck has a legendary creature card designated as its commander. This designation is not a characteristic of the object represented by the card; rather, it is an attribute of the card itself. The card retains this designation even when it changes zones.\n903.3a Some planeswalker cards have an ability that states the card can be your commander. This ability modifies the rules for deck construction, and it functions before the game begins. See also rule 113.6m.\n903.3b If a player\u2019s commander is a meld card and it\u2019s melded with the other member of its meld pair, the resulting melded permanent is that player\u2019s commander.\n903.3c If a player\u2019s commander is a component of a merged permanent, the resulting merged permanent is that player\u2019s commander.\n903.3d If an effect refers to controlling a commander, it refers to a permanent on the battlefield that is a commander. If an effect refers to casting a commander, it refers to a spell that is a commander. If an effect refers to a commander in a specific zone, it refers to a card in that zone that is a commander.\n903.4. The Commander variant uses color identity to determine what cards can be in a deck with a certain commander. The color identity of a card is the color or colors of any mana symbols in that card\u2019s mana cost or rules text, plus any colors defined by its characteristic-defining abilities (see rule 604.3) or color indicator (see rule 204).\n903.4a Color identity is established before the game begins.\n903.4b If a commander has a static ability that causes a player to choose its color before the game begins, that choice applies during deck construction and throughout the game, even as the commander changes zones. That choice affects the commander\u2019s color identity. The player reveals that choice as they put their commander into the command zone before the game begins. See rules 103.2c and 607.2n.\n903.4c Reminder text is ignored when determining a card\u2019s color identity. See rule 207.2.\n903.4d The back face of a double-faced card (see rule 711) is included when determining a card\u2019s color identity. This is an exception to rule 711.4a.\n903.4e If an ability refers to the colors or number of colors in a commander\u2019s color identity, that quality is undefined if that player doesn\u2019t have a commander. That part of the ability won\u2019t do anything. Costs that refer to that quality are unpayable.\n903.5. Each Commander deck is subject to the following deck construction rules.\n903.5a Each deck must contain exactly 100 cards, including its commander. In other words, the minimum deck size and the maximum deck size are both 100.\n903.5b Other than basic lands, each card in a Commander deck must have a different English name.\n903.5c A card can be included in a Commander deck only if every color in its color identity is also found in the color identity of the deck\u2019s commander.\n903.5d A card with a basic land type may be included in a Commander deck only if each color of mana it could produce is included in the commander\u2019s color identity.\n903.6. At the start of the game, each player puts their commander from their deck face up into the command zone. Then each player shuffles the remaining 99 cards of their deck so that the cards are in a random order. Those cards become the player\u2019s library.\n903.7. Once the starting player has been determined, each player sets their life total to 40 and draws a hand of seven cards.\n903.8. A player may cast a commander they own from the command zone. A commander cast from the command zone costs an additional {2} for each previous time the player casting it has cast it from the command zone that game. This additional cost is informally known as the \u201ccommander tax.\u201d\n903.9. A commander may return to the command zone during a Commander game.\n903.9a If a commander is in a graveyard or in exile and that card was put into that zone since the last time state-based actions were checked, its owner may put it into the command zone. This is a state-based action. See rule 704.\n903.9b If a commander would be put into its owner\u2019s hand or library from anywhere, its owner may put it into the command zone instead. This replacement effect may apply more than once to the same event. This is an exception to rule 614.5.\n903.9c If a commander is a melded permanent or a merged permanent and its owner chooses to put it into the command zone using the replacement effect described in rule 903.9b, that permanent and each component representing it that isn\u2019t a commander are put into the appropriate zone, and the card that represents it and is a commander is put into the command zone.\n903.10. The Commander variant includes the following specification for winning and losing the game. All other rules for ending the game also apply. (See rule 104.)\n903.10a A player that\u2019s been dealt 21 or more combat damage by the same commander over the course of the game loses the game. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)\n903.11. If a player is allowed to bring a card from outside the game into a Commander game, that player can\u2019t bring a card into the game this way if it has the same name as a card that player had in their starting deck, if it has the same name as a card that the player has already brought into the game, or if any color in its color identity isn\u2019t in the color identity of the player\u2019s commander.\n903.12. Brawl Option\n903.12a Brawl is an option for a different style of Commander game. Brawl games use the normal rules for the Commander variant with the following modifications.\n903.12b Brawl decks are usually constructed using cards from the Standard format.\n903.12c A player designates either a legendary planeswalker or a legendary creature as their commander.\n903.12d A player\u2019s deck must contain exactly 60 cards, including its commander. In other words, the minimum deck size and the maximum deck size are both 60.\n903.12e If a player\u2019s commander has no colors in its color identity, that player\u2019s deck may contain any number of basic lands of one basic land type of their choice. This is an exception to rule 903.5d.\n903.12f In a two-player Brawl game, each player\u2019s starting life total is 25. In a multiplayer Brawl game, each player\u2019s starting life total is 30.\n903.12g In any Brawl game, the first mulligan a player takes doesn\u2019t count toward the number of cards that player will put on the bottom of their library or the number of mulligans that player may take. Subsequent mulligans are counted toward these numbers as normal.\n903.12h Brawl games do not use the state-based action described in rule 704.6c, which causes a player to lose the game if they\u2019ve been dealt 21 or more combat damage by a commander.\n903.13. Commander Draft\n903.13a Commander Draft is an option for a different style of Commander game. It consists of a draft (a style of limited play where players choose cards from sealed booster packs to build their decks) followed by a multiplayer game. The Commander Draft option uses Commander Legends booster packs by default.\n903.13b A draft typically consists of three draft rounds. In each draft round, each player opens a booster pack, drafts two cards by placing them in a face-down pile in front of them, then passes the remaining cards to the next player. Each player then drafts two cards from the booster pack passed to them and passes the remaining cards. This procedure continues until all cards in that draft round have been drafted.\n903.13c In the first and third draft rounds, booster packs are passed to each player\u2019s left. In the second draft round, booster packs are passed to each player\u2019s right.\n903.13d During the draft, a player can look only at cards in the booster pack they are currently drafting from and cards they have already drafted. A player may not reveal drafted cards to other players unless an ability instructs them to.\n903.13e After the draft is complete, the cards a player drafted become that player\u2019s card pool. A player may add up to two cards named The Prismatic Piper to their card pool, but only if those cards are used as the player\u2019s commander(s).\n903.13f Commander Draft deck construction follows the same rules as Commander deck construction (see rule 903.5) with two exceptions: (1) A player\u2019s deck must contain at least 60 cards. There is no maximum deck size. (2) A player\u2019s deck may include any number of cards from that player\u2019s card pool with the same name.\n903.13g Commander Draft games follow the same rules as Commander games.
